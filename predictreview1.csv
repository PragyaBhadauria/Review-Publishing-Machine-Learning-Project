review,('This company is not just a fraud to its employees but also to its customers. \r\n\r\n1) Employees: They make it sound like rainbows and glitters while u enter this company; just like how some current employees are forced to review here.  I would not complain about work pressure if it was fruitful. The founders will not understand the process and would make u do  the same cobbler work over and again and finally would blame u for not being efficient. Their data is flawed; Their POA is flawed ! \r\n          The other thing is they give you a series of fake promises.  My offer letter has a PF summing 3000. (1.5k from my salary). But the pay slips that was given to me had a PF of Rs.970. This was done without my concern.  But when I tried to claim the PF of over 1 year, they have deposited only 4k. I relieved from the company but was sent out without letting me complete my notice period. I relieved on 12th of the month but was given only 6% of my salary.2)Customers: This company does the biggest of violations when it comes to medico legal data. These data are supposed to be highly confidential. But the medical records of doctors using this software  can be accessed by anyone at the backend without the knowledge of the doctors.\r\n             They scrap data from competitive companies and steal their strategies by employing their former employees. They use cracked versions of softwares like Microsoft which might end in ceasing the hardwares of the company if Microsoft came to know about it. This can affect the employees using their own laptops.\r\n',)

review,("The best part about JP Morgan Equity Research is that you can get relocated to a foreign location. For example I was working with the London team and had an opportunity to move to London. Colleagues were majorly from tier 1 institutes and hence the environment was very intellectually stimulating. Plus a lot of us used to wait for the free dinner which was only available if you wait till post 8pm. I think the work is good if one wants to do an MBA post working here. I wanted to start my own company and it was foolish of me to think that the work would give me experience that is relevant. I realized that soon and hence quit early. A lot of my colleagues went on to do MBA's from top tier US colleges and many of them relocated to foreign locations. Also, JP Morgan reimburses the amount if you clear CFA exams. That I felt was really helpful as not all companies have this benefit.    \r\n\r\nOverall culture is good and people at JPM are very approachable. The work is pretty hectic but of course it varies from team to team. Some of the work I felt was very repetitive and uninteresting. I was there for a very short duration, so maybe initially that could be the case for any new joinee. Learning completely depends on you. I felt that the time you get for yourself (self-development or otherwise) at JP Morgan is very less. There were some learning sessions that were conducted where a team member would talk about his knowledge of the sector he/she are tracking. That wasn't taken seriously and was done pretty much just to complete credits. ",)

Laptops will be given to all employees irrespective of their designation.\r\nFree transport is provided both ways. Medical insurance for employee, spouse and children are paid by the company. Medical policies are also very good which is not given in other MNCs. Career growth is less. Senior people stick on to their jobs forever and no promotions are given to the juniors. To get a promotion it takes minimum 3-4 years to work in the same role. When asked for a promotion they say there are so many seniors waiting in the pipeline and our chance will be only after theirs. Pay wise also not that great.\r\nCareer growth will happen only in the same domain. For ex: If someone is good in programming or bigdata and if they are working in technical support department, the management allows them to move only in tech support team and they wont be given a chance to move to development field.\r\nIf people support printers, they can only grow in that line.

review,('Challenges! This will build you, really I mean it. Any fresher coming out of a college will get the real big bold flavour of how a corporate work. You get All the issues spiked up here so when you move to new company and face issues you will be prepared as it will feel very light to you because you have handled a lot tougher situation in HCL!\r\nCurrently they are not giving chances for any Training due to lack of staffing, appraisal?... Peanuts?... No.....FlaxSeed size. Job security is there somewhat. Behaviour of team depends upon managers, most managers let Politics grow and then Cutoff /isolate one they want, it\'s common practice here.Every company has a pattern and this is HCL\'s way.

review,("While i was in the Head Office (Gurgaon) for training purpose i had enjoyed most of the drishti. Colleagues and seniors were helpful and supportive. That environment was nice. I always had thought in my mind that my professional life has started. Drishti was really taking very good care of mine in terms of accommodation and all. I really liked the few of the drishti's policies ( health insurance, travelling policy etc) After completing the training i was sent back to mumbai. Initial few months went well. But after that I stopped enjoying my job. It has lots of travelling, no fixed shifts, no fixed working hours. There were few days when I used to travel more than 70 kms (one side ) daily to reach the client location. \r\n\r\nI still remember the day when i had traveled more than 70 to reach the client location and after extending my shift to 11 hours one of our account personal was unhappy with me because he wanted me to be there for more one hour ( i had to traveled back to home, again more than 70 kms of travelling)  and  I am really thankful to my TL, that day he fought for me. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn last couple of month I had stared missing my self. Because due to hectic schedule  and lots of travelling i was unable to give time to myself and my family. I was also upset when I come to know that Drishti fired a large number of peoples because i had few very good friends in those peoples.\r\n\r\n\r\n",)

As I am the SME for supplier risk assessment, I get to market research, talk to senior leadership (country procurement) and discuss and finalize process maps for risk in their country.\r\nThis process has given so much to learn and growth, both professionally and personally.I am the kind of person who likes to attain that level of perfection in process, make your mark, pass it on and move onto another process (and that is all within realm of procurement). This gives me a great opportunity to learn various aspects of supply chain industry.\r\nAt MetLife, things get monotonous at times, and you really have to be at your supervisor's neck to request them to get rid of this mundane thing in your work. As a result, people with skills have moved out as there were less opportunities presented. The last thing, concentration of work (most travels, leading client relationship etc.) is with a selected individuals who are boss's favourite and others are not given opportunity to expand their skills and horizon.",)

It won't be appropriate to take names here but I would describe three persons with whom I've worked closely. (1) My immediate reporting head who was the Team Lead of our BA department, is a gem of a person. His few attributes are as follows - Razor sharp mind/Extremely Helpful/Very patient/Professional/Very knowledgeable/Almost egoless !! I have learnt a lot from him !!! (2) Product Head - This man took my interview and I can say that he taught me the art of business analysis. He is another gem of  person and has helped me immensely in my work. He was not a BOSS but a MENTOR !! From arranging training to creating new stuff from scratch, he taught us all. (3) R&D Head - What can I say about this man !! He is the embodiment of sheer brilliance !!Not much actually. Every company runs within a budget and withing it's own budget Ginesys is doing pretty well. U can't expect the company to bring U the moon in your hand. Yes, there's always scope of improvement. The pace of work is a little slow and since it's a product based organization, it has limited its work to a single business domain so the work sometimes get boring. ",)

review,("This company rates minus in all things as such to start of the day you start from 10 am but the employer will simply argue with you and insult u on the floor itself if you even try to leave before 8 -8:30 . That goes for females as well . The CEO has no manners to communicate to his employees. Males or females except for 1-2 feet licking cheap staff he has hired. As such he claims to be a MNC company but that's not even a communication of what we do in an MNC . It's 6 days working , no perks , no benefits . moreover he will hire Freshers as he doesn't have the budget to go beyond 10-12k and post joining after 1 month he brings in a bond to bind you to the. Company only if he feels you are ok . Mind it OK because as per to him nobody in this world is more knowledgeable than him. Or else he will just throw you out at one day notice . No HR policies , HR is just peon to them who will do things like bargaining with the vendors or toilet cleaners . Or take out quotes for his personal use . Moreover he will not release your salary till the time you don't put a positive reviews on internet for his company. All he can afford in name of parties is taking contributions from all employees or max he can make you happy with roadside samosas. No farewall from the company it's done by employees contribution for only a group of people & that too if you belong to that group. Don't even expect your salary before 18-20th of any month as he never has. Money . As he stays in London he's always humiliating Indians & Indian staff . What a cheap man he's a big  shame on being called as Indian.",)

These are surviving because still unorganised sector is not functioning to its best, I am sure once that happens they will have to find other ways to live with.\r\nComing back to work culture with what we should stick, on book its all beautiful but when it will come on practice you will get the real shocker.\r\nUsually people dont dare to write down such things considering there future growth.\r\nIn short there work culture on books. Its always the people which makes the difference, I feel the Area manager level is all has tremendous need to perform.\r\nAny ways they have everything on books when it comes to apply the dont find the spirit in the books.\r\nI wish I can write about how things are moulded.\r\nIn short if you are a person who doesn't live his life on edge and wants a so calles secure job, go for it.\r\nThis company has great things to follow but they will rather use them against you and yes forget personal growth and all.

review,("It's a good hospital to work with but only as a fresher. I like all the doctors. The treatment over here is superb. There is no sacrifice in the treatment. But as an employee, in initial period they do not give you work, they do not tell you your job responsibilities, no training, no support and you feel like what to do and you wait for the salary to come and while working, everyday you look for better opportunity as there is no growth in the organization. People who are working for a long time by buttering the people in upper management and doing their personal tasks are on the same designation without a salary hike as they earn upper income more than their salary by doing fraud within the organization and by making people fool.If you are free and want to spoil yourself, your passion, work ethics,, professionalism or to get mad or want to learn to lie to ill and innocent people, go ahead and join the organization but remember one thing, one day you will also get sick and your deeds will do your justice. This is not the organization for true people who want to grow with self esteem, dignity and hard work but for fake and free people.There is no management in the organization. No job roles assigned and worst, there is no job security. When you work there, you work as a slave of your boss, there is always a doubt that weather you would go tomorrow or not and what if they ask you to resign for no reason. They make you do whatever they want. No professionalism. They do not even know how to behave with an employee.",)

review,('nothing much. only one : one can prepare for other companies or exams like IES/GRE, sitting in office without much disturbance, given that he can act like a sycophant towards the higher ranked people and teach them things (about technical subjects, software, fixed deposit schemes, flat prices in Mumbai area) whatever they ask for. (mostly applicable to RIC division of the company) you are paid for acting like a private teacher who teach people higher in rank, about technical things, software and listen/answer to their foolish doubts whenever they ask, only to be humiliated afterwards by the same person during appraisal stating "you should improve your English, subject knowledge". Seniors expect you to educate them and they will try to get the attention of their seniors, by saying the same thing that you taught them, only a bit loudly (showing confidence) as if they themselves cracked the puzzle! No career development, namesake training by internal people most of whom didn\'t have much experience, full politics. When an employee joins he will be educated about values and hardwork which the preacher himself don\'t follow. Generally an employee starts to work harder initially to make a impression, to improve/better the company\'s overall image, only to discover in the end that his efforts don\'t get appreciated as his reporting officer got all the credit for the job.

review,("It has been an awesome 5 years with Allianz now, started off in the role of an Analyst, now part of Service Now team as a Senior Analyst. The team mates at Allianz are very understanding and cooperative in situations that need a team effort. Job security is great. There was a major DCC program leading to shifts in profiles and programs but the good thing is employees were never left out of options at Allianz. I appreciate my company on that note for holding an employee's satisfaction as primary. Since the company has a global client base, we have enough opportunities to visit Germany more than once in these 5 years. Colleagues from different locations, culture work here in great collaboration to deliver what is the best for the clients. The Hr policies concerning re-hire, leave, sabbatical, etc. are satisfactory.\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n\r\nA review of salary for employees working for a long time should be timely performed and the salary should be market adjusted accordingly.The salary is not revised according to market standards. A salary revisal should be done every three years apart from the yearly appraisal because an employee has to take care of his general expenses in the same society where inflation never eases down. If not beat inflation, at the least care should be taken an employee is not badly affected by inflation due to his poor salary revisal.",)

review,("The company having a innovation and readily adopts latest technology for productions. Set up a  Asia largest factory at Chandigarh  manufacturing unit for Laminates with European standard and additional products like Cubicles , solid surface, and has a global client base more on export oriented business and not focus on pan India Market.  No Job security, and not getting the travel expenses in time. You have to spent on your own money then you have to claim. The claim will be reimburse after 45 to 60 days and most of the expenses will be disallowed by the Management and no information for deduction.\r\nNo proper appointment letter to the staff in time and HR will take their own time to send the appointment letter. In the meantime most of them have submitted  their resignation and no HR Policy. Those who are working in good organisation for more than 10 to 15 years immediately absorb them with higher package in the company and with in few month they will ask them to leave without having any reason and notice.  No settlement and compensation will be happened once you leave the organisation. Also there is no on job training for fresher's, hence senior folks like me have to guide them to achieve the set target step by step which is pain full. Management decision is final in any aspect and show their arrogance with all.  ",)
review,('The company is very strong in technology and has lot of potentials. I love my work and company now and do my best without much interference of others.  Onsite opportunities are available and techno exposure will be an advantage. Rehire policy is a major welcome, company started moving towards HR driven and started yielding proven results. The new management is positive and understanding and treats everyone equally.In the past (till six months back)  it was an individual driven company and compensation was decent for those who were loyal to boss. Work life balance was NIL and you are a paid slave except for few blue eyed boys. Job Security was a big joke in the past a person awarded as best employee will be fired for poor performance with no questions asked. Exit interview was a formality which never used to go to Top management. Lot of human landmines were placed to play the role of informers to the boss and subsequently get targeted to harass. Being in middle or senior level also you are not supposed to open your mouth nor you can have any healthy debate. If you do so you will be shunted out immediately.Spreading of rumors against individuals and popularize those rumors among people with the help of selected team was a tool used by earlier management so as to embarrass and force someone to leave the company.',)

noreview,('Only researchers and scholars come from different parts of the country and even from abroad since English & Foreign Languages University (EFLU) is a premier institution as far as English & other 8 foreign languages (Arabic, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Italian, Russian, Spanish)  languages and literature is concerned.  The EFLU Library has a rich collection in the form of books, periodicals, theses, manuscripts, CDs and other related national and international databases. The outsiders also some times tells us some of the titles available outside which are not available in our Library we procure them and add to our library collection.  This is a good sign and helps us to make the library with a full-fledged collection.  They also tell us about their library functioning, services, activities, collection etc. We take them into consideration and implement certain suggestions which are suitable and convenient for our library.  We some times dislike the attitude of the outside users of our Library.  They come with rural background with indisciplined manners.  To educate them, it takes time.  Further, the staff is especially required for this purpose.  For our students and research scholars, we give induction in the beginning of each academic year.  Hence no need to teach them every time about the library rule.and regulations and utilisation of library services.  But the problem is with the outsiders.  Even we show power point presentation on how to use the library resources, they do no catch and understand immediately.  Valuable time is being wasted to train them to use our library collection.  Still, we are planning to benefit them in their own style of understanding.  There is a change now.',)

How we are suppose to maintain the balance when our primary salary is late??? Their brain is not grwon enough to understand this.This company is one of the worst companys to work with. Typical owner & labourer culture. All people all the time think to save their job. there is lot of buttering. The head office is in shit and looks like godown. Do not go by their corporate video if they have on their website. No canteen. If u go out lets say for 15 minutes u have to fill outgoing slip and these 15 mins will be deducted from ur entire day so u have to sit extra 15 mins. Work place is like hell. All cockroaches, rats will come when u start eating food. Ur working area is like fourth seat in local train. The security is kept not for employee security but to check their baggage while coming & going out. And the security will harrass u like anything. In package they will offer you cake but will not give anything in writing. so when you join, ur package will be totally different (much less) and u end up earning less than ur previous salary. DO NOT JOIN. Or u will get frustrated all your life and you will loose ur carrer',)

Typical owner & labourer culture. All people all the time think to save their job. there is lot of buttering. The head office is in shit and looks like godown. Do not go by their corporate video if they have on their website. No canteen. If u go out lets say for 15 minutes u have to fill outgoing slip and these 15 mins will be deducted from ur entire day so u have to sit extra 15 mins. Work place is like hell. All cockroaches, rats will come when u start eating food. Ur working area is like fourth seat in local train. The security is kept not for employee security but to check their baggage while coming & going out. And the security will harrass u like anything. In package they will offer you cake but will not give anything in writing. so when you join, ur package will be totally different (much less) and u end up earning less than ur previous salary. DO NOT JOIN. Or u will get frustrated all your life and you will loose ur carrer',)

Team mates are very co operative.You can learn a lot from this company and get trained in this field.The company is open to innovation and develops good products within avaialble resources.You will have a good career growth if you are dedicated to the organisation and contributed to achieve the organisational goal. You will love your job and feel happy to become a part of the organisation. Being export oriented company you remain alway updated with latest technical know how and trends in the business.Nothing to dislike but there is least attention on training and almost no investment on reinnovation. Replacement of old machines and purchase of new technology is necessary to compete in this throatcutting competitive market. Besides this there is no job security and the management wants to replace it's manpower frequently without any issue. Training and development part is completely missing here and in senior position, now a days dirty politics and leg pulling has started due to which honest and hard working people are feeling suffocation. Management does not value an individual's strength.Board members have enough  power and only their advice is honoured even when  they are wrong.",)

review,('Working from the right client location will open doors. Due to a severe lack in quality of team leaders and managers, a strong QA can outshine and become indispensable. The exposure would be immense and such a relatively small role will have huge implications. \r\n\r\nWipro also has good learn while you earn programs. I myself pursued one and it was pretty decent. Pay is drastically lower than industry median. A 5 year tenure System Administrator in Wipro Technologies working as a vendor for a leading OS oriented company and a Team Lead in Wipro BPO working as a vendor for a leading search oriented company earn roughly the same around  30k. Both are typically post graduates. \r\n\r\nWork culture is poor and outdated. I worked in both Wipro BPO and Wipro Technologies and the latter is worse than the former. In the former at least I was extremely fortunate to work from a client location that is an international hallmark. \r\n\r\nQuality of intake is heavily compromised which creates team friction and a lack of mental compatibility. \r\n\r\nWipro is woefully bureaucratic and unorganized so you could end up creating same content over and over again. This also shows in resolving your issue which typically takes days or weeks to resolve, if that. \r\n\r\nTransport is notorious and shabby.',)

review,("The work culture at SAP can be ranked as one of the best in the industry. Employees are treated as individuals and not resources. Employees are given a lot of freedom in terms of flexible working hours and ownership of what they do.Apart from this, you gets hands on opportunity to work on ssveral technologies and modules. The work one does seldom becomes monotonous and more often than not you end up doing something different everyday. Even though there's a hierarchy system on paper, there's no tangible boundary that separtes employees. Everyone's willing to help you at difficult times and there's hardly any internal politics. Long story short, SAP is unique in the way it handles its employees. There's a fine treading line between freedom and negligence, but some people end up equating the two. Sometimes you find yourself doing a lot of work which you were not supposed to do. As a result, more often than not, you find one or two people bearing the entire burden of the team. In addition, life sometimes becomes quite laid back. Even though, you are willing to do a lot, there's hardly anything substantial for you to contribute. I had to do a lot of soul searching to come up with these two points. Jeez, it's difficult to find points that you dislike about SAP.",)

review,("This is my honest opinion. The only good thing about Mmodal is that you can earn good amount of salary, but on one condition (only if you get an easy account). If you get a tough account then forget about that too. The work environment was good, very friendly colleagues.I dislike pretty much everything about the company. The employees are treated like shit as if it is labor work.

When I worked there, I would get my week off every once in 8 to 9 days and that too in night shifts and if you aren't lucky they will ask you to come on that day too scheduling your week off to next day. My health deteriorated so much (due to GERD) that I had to quit my job and you don't get an alternative shift. It purely depends upon your luck whether you get good or bad account. I had some friends who were very poor at training, but were lucky in getting good accounts that the trainers themselves were shocked at their performance. The canteen was worst, they closed it anyways. The management is never satisfied at your work no matter how hard you perform they just want results. I don't have the habit of lying, this is my honest experience working there. I hope this review will help someone.",)

review,('Takata as a company is very interesting to work. The work culture is open and free. Till now it is a Japanese company and they are very professional and of course task masters. Takata believes only in team work and do not appreciate individuals who do not believe in team work. Training is considered as one of the most important responsibility of the company.

review,('Takata as a company is very interesting to work. The work culture is open and free. Till now it is a Japanese company and they are very professional and of course task masters.

review,("One of the best places to work where the team is life a friend for you. You can share all the issues with them and they are ready to stand for you at every time.\r\nTraining is availed to all the employees on a regular basis apart from real time hands on experience. I would say the job security is more than any other organization as only work is rewarded.\r\nMaybe appraisal takes a bit longer, but it happens and an employee gets more than what he/she is expecting when appraisal happens. You wont get a cab facility, but located in the heart of the city, there is no issue in travelling. You will be able to learn a lot from all of your seniors and colleagues. Nice work culture and environment.\r\nBest thing that I have seen in the organization that you are allowed to put forward your innovation skills for your and your company's growth but inspite of Night shift, you will be able to balance in your work-life, but you have to be smart enough...  Good luckI just had one dislike in my organization about the emerging Politics in higher management and this was the only reason I decided to quit. I would not say this does not happen in any organization, however I did not like it. After all, your personal opinion always matters somewhere in your life.",)

In my case i had opportunity to work on a different technology. So it was quite good fro me from learning perspective.\r\n- Work environment is average. Don't expect too much from the management. They always keep inventing new policies for their own benefit.\r\n- Innovation word is not present in their vocabulary. \r\n- Work life balance is average.\r\nManagement is a big problem there.

review,("The only thing I liked about working at IBM Daksh Kolkata was the canteen - ridiculous,isn't it ? Sad but true. The variety of food and it's quality stood out in direct contrast to the garbage dump of a process I was working in.I was hired as a subject matter expert. But soon I realised that I was only here because of my German skills ( I was brought up in Berlin ,Germany and worked as a German lecturer at Max Mueller Bhavan Kolkata before joining IBM. The team of supervisors working there did not even have basic level 2 German skills, and yet had somehow managed to secure their positions, even though for a German process , anyone at supervisory level must possess advanced level skills in German, both spoken and written. A few days after working with them I realised their level of German was worse than that of the illegal immigrants whom I used to see regularly in Germany. And , surprise surprise, they were also sent to Germany regularly for training. What a joke ! They had only hired me to do their work, while taking all the credit themselves. I was not sent for training to Germany once, even though that had been mentioned in my contract at the time of my recruitment. So I left after 6 months.",)

review,("It's a new company but looks like just another IT services company. It's a company formed by merger of two big established companies so future looks very promising but nothing can be told at the moment.Company was formed by the merger of HPE Enterprise service division and CSC corporation merger on April 2017. With that said, you cannot review the company and its policies as of now because it is still having a mixed culture of HPE and CSC. A review can be done maybe after 2 years.\r\n\r\nBut one thing is for sure, NEVER EVER join the US Health care projects in DXC. You will get to see WORST kind of management with pathetically dumb witted managers and people.\r\nThe company has inherited one culture from HPE : (BOOT LICKING is the only way to SUCCEED). I may not apply to entire company but US health care projects stinks.\r\n\r\nAlso, it is very hard to determine HR's role in this company, they are invisible dark matters of this organisation (Inherited this culture from HPE). Maybe in next 1-2 years things will change(Hopefully).\r\n\r\nNO proper Portal. There is no central place where you can get everything. There is portal for every other thing but all are scattered here and there(Very frustrating). \r\n",)

At the end of day u ll be criticized for what u have not done yet.\r\n- Manager give too much work. But dont think how will the person do. And u end up being criticized.\r\n-Safety is good. But due to stringent safety rules, unnecessary hectic comes the way.\r\n-You may be given works which you dont owns. Sometimes you have to look for work of other department/stream people. eg; mechanical looking after civil jobs.\r\n-The bloody bells curve that control your appraisal, manager always try to show your weakness rather strength.\r\n-You are not rewarded as you deserve.\r\n-other company does not recruits you as u are vedanta people, as ur work culture is not good.',)

In my experience i can say indian five star hotels are similar with abroad restaurant. As a CDP how much the duties and responsibilities it would equal to sous chef position in five star hotels in india. Really lot of things have to learn from abroad like management and development. Apart from the chef roles there is vast responsibilities like HACCP, SOP, GHP, GMP, FIFO etc. And whatever i have learned from my previous organisation mean kharafi global huge tactful knowledge which will help to build my career in future life. \r\n\r\nThanks Company most worst thing is increments about the workers, never thinking about the employee that is the diligence and toil has been taking they never look for that.

review,('Firstly i would like to share the company its really good to work and pleasure environment with different cultures people. In my experience i can say indian five star hotels are similar with abroad restaurant. As a CDP how much the duties and responsibilities it would equal to sous chef position in five star hotels in india. Really lot of things have to learn from abroad like management and development. Apart from the chef roles there is vast responsibilities like HACCP, SOP, GHP, GMP, FIFO etc. And whatever i have learned from my previous organisation mean kharafi global huge tactful knowledge which will help to build my career in future life. \r\n\r\nThanks Company most worst thing is increments about the workers, never thinking about the employee that is the diligence and toil has been taking they never look for that. If any one want to continue his or her job he can do neither leave.

I was promoted last year and was awarded for doing exceptionally good but all of a sudden my performance went bad (according to them). Even HR can't save you if your manager decides what to be done. Poor career development and there is no growth in the company as well. Poor and slow decision makers in the top level. Slow paced environment and if you are not worried about growth and wants to have laid back work then you can enjoy the luxury (only if you are in manager's good books). Poor rating system, Goal setting is done in April, mid year review in July or August and by October you have to furnish your final review (Nov to March work???)",)

After i had joined, no internal calls for  project and after 2 1/2 months, got a call from HR and i was told, your bench period is over, you have to resign and given a white paper. This is not only happened with me but 300 employees in a week. Still they are following  the same process and thats why always HCL recruits almost everyweek. Its like governament company where still recommandations happens for internal project.No job security As i have mentioned earlier, within 3 months you should get a project. and this is not possible for all. Because all project assignations happens based on recommendations. after 2  months on bech, HR will call you and ask you to resign on a white paper. Resignation to be submitted by the system, but here they ask to sign on white paper which is illegal. No repect for the mployees and its like managers and HRs like LORDS. bossism and slavery does exists. Recently compnay started hiring freshers by taking 3 lakhs from them, this is also not safe for seniors jobs.',)

Tools used are developed for in-house use, they add zero value to your skill set. 6 days working and work timings are pathetic. Conference calls till late night and even on Sundays. You cannot take 2 days off back to back and if there is a public holiday on Saturday or Monday, you have to be present for half day in office. On Mondays you have to report in office at 7am, even when the customers open after 9 or 9:30 am! Poor working style, unethical employees and poor HR policies. Be unemployed but don't work here, you'll de-grow mentally and professionally. Good luck!  ",)

Yearly holiday we have to ask multiple times for date and tickets, in some occasions they will ask expat to do his (family) ticket him self and later reimburse , where they kept off shore salary pending for past multiple months.

review,("The IT Team is good, helpful and works with team spirit, good learning exposure to .net as fresher. Wanted negative rating facility also, really frustrating work environment, cheapest level of politics, the lowest amount of salary (5k) to be precise for entry level, and only promise about improving working conditions and pay package (which never will materialize). Machine quality at local railway stations is better than that you work on here for development. In spite of such low salary, your salary will be deducted if you reach office by 9:01 am. I would recommend a fresher to join only if you want a break in technology, and eager to learn, AND DONT' PLAN LONG TERM ASSOCIATION WITH THIS COMPANY. Still, if you get an opportunity to work with this company, try and avoid as much as you can. You also will face a lot of trouble while resigning, many employees who were with me went without any relevant documents since company was not at all ready to hand over, in spite of serving notice\r\nP.S.: I've worked at this company for 1.5 years and faced this myself.",)

Once you know what mess you re in you ll quit n so has been the trend but tge employers are least bothered about it. They have seriously nothing to do with their such high attrition rate n dont even want to do anything about it. No such thing as exit interview n nobody even wants to take a feedback as they would already know it will be negative. The average duration a consultant stays here in 6 months. Nobody stays longer. Salaries r deducted without any reason. So basically tgey dont have any policy. They do as they feel like. Treat their employees as slaves.  I want to write so much more but theres word limits. In short i would never recommend anyone to join this org. Especially Ggn office as the manager is shit. I have very cordial relations with all my ex bosses till date but this one is an exception. Also d energy in ofc is so negative. Other hr n admin ppl who sits in mumbai r useless.Worst manager ever. All she cares about is her personal life n her dates tgat she goes for saying client meeting n rest of d day she is never in ofc. Doesnt know how to lead a team or how to work at first place. She gives u a mandate today n she needs d profile by evening. N in between there has been changes in d location,etc. U put ur effort for d closure. So heres what happens. In between either she ll hand it over to sm1 else without u knowing about it even if u r on verge of closing it. Or if d closure is done sm1 else might receive d credit for it. This has happened with a couple of ppl including me so I know. She ll share ur email password with d team..ur laptop password. Ac never works n everyone keeps sweating but nothing has been done for that n its been over a year now. If you are taken out for lunch saying its team outing you need to pay for that. If manager doesnt want to sit in ofc..she would ask d entire team to gather at any of d coffee house n again u wud pay ur bills.',)

They changed their office's location and went God knows where. \r\nSo, If they offer you a job and you are reading this, don't go. And if you are client, don't give then any projects, i know how they work. There is nothing genuine they copy from others and they charge you a lot for something that is very cheap and better that yo",)

We teachers also joined in various sports competition which took place within the campus. So I liked all these things that teaching isn't the only thing we teacher did and being a teacher I had not only taught but had also gained a lot of knowledge.The timing was a problem for me and the salary was comparatively low. I didn't get much time to take rest so some health issue arose like low blood pressure etc. As I was staying alone in Golaghat and had a busy schedule so I didn't get much time to interact with friends and family and missed a lot of family functions.",)

They say 21% of your CTC is your variable pay which is not part of CTC and will be paid to you twice in a year. But when you join the company you realize that your CTC is inclusive of 21%. Say they offer you CTC of 5 LPA, then per above statement 5lk*21%= 105000 is variable apart from CTC. but in reality 5 lk is divided as 395000 is fixed and 105000 is variable. Now based on second half you are supposed to receive 105000 amount twice in year. However again there is bluff they divide 105000 by 2 and serve you twice in year but not 100%. this amount is based on your performance. No matter how well you perform they always pin point you and let you down. In my tenure of 3 yrs, i have seen company have provided max 65% of variable pay, which was the highest pay ever received by any employee.\r\nDO NOT JOIN THIS COMPANY NO MATTER WHATEVER THEY OFFER YOU.',)

review,('The work hours in Merlin is the only thing acceptable compared to the rest of the factors. Official hours 10-6.30 which might get stretched at times due to work, deadlines, events or meetings.There is nothing much to like about Merlin. Compensation is decent but they tend to hire everyone at a lower pay scale than the previous company. Growth is very slow and often depends on how well you can sweet talk the higher management and be in their good books. Keeping in mind the company culture, the employees who really want to sustain their career here are also bound to be similar, disunited and uncooperative. There is absolutely no job security. You can be thrown out in less than 24 hours if the management suddenly starts disliking you. Office politics is too much to let you work in peace for even a day. The higher authority is contemptible to an extent of causing both verbal and physical abuse (very rare and to men only), including to women. Over all, one of the worst places to be in.',)

The job was important to me as I had moved back to my home town in Mangalore to attend to personal commitments & couldn't afford to have a gap in my resume during the period. Probably the situation I was in proved advantageous to the Company & hence their offer. The third party consultant (Manpower Group) I was tied to was one of the worst in terms of service and cooperation! Had to struggle to even get my monthly salary paid to me! The Client group from Accenture Services Pvt. Ltd, for whom I was employed, showed no interest in helping out. Getting my relieving letter at the end of the contract term was a whole different story. Wouldn't recommend working there unless the candidate has verified that their contract is in place & that they are on the direct payroll of Accenture.",)

Thus, in one batch i.e. from 9am-6pm I was teaching nearly 70 students in two different classes simultaneously. Apart from that I was training new faculties (nearly 10-14) at the same time. This was not an issue for me until they wrote "trainer" on my experience letter instead of "senior trainer".\r\n Moreover, there is no fixed date for salary. That too, they pay in cash. So, in peak season they pay on 11th/12th so that if anyone is planning to leave the organization she already wastes half month. One might have to wait until 8 pm coz all the employees of a branch get salary on single day. And if you are on leave you\'ll get  your salary probably two weeks later.\r\nThe coordinator can ask you to stay and perform and sing a song(while a video is made) in order to impress the higher authority.\r\nAll in all, the work environment is suffocating.

The leadership is not open to new ideas,are very poor leaders and terrible at being mentors (unless it is in the art of BS), being honest and direct. There is no career in the organization, simply stagnation, worse than what can be experienced in a government organization. If you do not fall in line with leaders and their cliques then all thoughts and ideas are considered blasphemous. They hire senior resources from the market and waste their talents and skills, brow beating them into submission and absolute stupidity, whilst at the same time making sure that they are paid well. At the end of your tenure you realize you have nothing to show on your resume (except butt kiss) and you are paid way above the market. IT IS A GOLDEN CAGE!

The package is also quite good as i have joined as a fresher. ICICI Prudential is giving oppourtunities to the youths or we can say fresher where they donot see the background of the students neither their previous experiences. Its a perfect example for other companies too where they are looking for experienced guys only. Its a perfect example that freshers can do the same work what the experienced guys do. Experience doesnot matter the dedication and passion towards your work is what it all matters.My personal experience is what i dislike about ICICI Prudential is that there is too much pressure of sales which i dislike the most. The work pressure is very high.Moreover the reimbursement process is too slow.',)

You have to steal time from u'r work to learn about something.Actually everything is worth disliking about this comapany. It will ruin your personal as well as professional life. You will regret right after working here for 3-4 months. 12 hrs mandatory shifting duty during 6 months of season,it may continue up to 14 /16 hrs bt never less than 12,just work like slaves. Won't get any overtime allowance (mine is 8 rs/hr and I am an engg),no weekly off during this period. You have to battle against your boss if u want some casual leaves,u have to go through various humiliating q&a processes to get u'r rightfull leaves. You have to forget about salary and increment and leave. Do not go for its brand name,better try other place. ",)
