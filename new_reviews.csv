review,"I started my career from this company and it's much better than I expected. The whole team is young and very friendly. Timings are flexible. One thing I like about startups is you can branch out to other fields too and people here are very open to this idea. Hierarchy is flat, you can reach out to anyone you want directly. Team is very talented and qualified so you have great learning opportunities. Even working as an Intern I never felt like neglected, everyone has equal saying in every decision. And lastly the office lunch. You can order free lunch of your choice on swiggy app. And the food is delicious. So all in all I wasn't expecting this much, but here it is!"

review,Salary should be a bit high.... no Problem in Salary deduction if their is a valid reason but show the reason..
review,"This list is quite long as compared -(i) The company is plagued by the sick old mentalities due to old generation people working over here. These people believe in not imparting work related knowledge and training to their subordinates  so that they them self remain in the limelight. Consequently the new generation being employed is purely depended on itself to gather information and knowledge about the  equipment which was manufactured long ago . The same goes for people working in non-tech field as they also face similar kind of problem. (ii) Annual appraisal is purely based on the amount of oiling that is being done to the seniors by the subordinates and not on the basis of how or what you work.(iii) You will face a totally filthy environment within the office. Every decision made by the management is a decision of the filthy politics that persists in the company.(iv) People are transferred not on the basis of requirement rather on the basis of decisions made on personal relations. (v) Most importantly , the supervisor group of the company is deprived of major facilities of the company, viz promotion policy, pay scale etc. Not even proper work exposure is being given just because the people sitting on top of you dont want you to learn and grow. (vi) The lowest paying Defence PSU among all is GRSE. You are not getting paid much as compared to other shipyards."

review,"If you are looking for a place to learn politics- 1E is the right one for you. Its a family owned business and the owners (3-4 of them) are basically crazy. DO-NOT join the India office. No matter who you are and how good you are, the two ladies (you know who) will make it a living hell for you. And if you are really good at your job, you are in for a war! This place is just for incompetents so if you fall in this category, 1E will be a disneyland for you. The funny part is the highest number of incompetent people work from the Noida office.  On top of all this, people are highly judgmental (especially the two ladies). Be careful who you talk to. 1E is a place where stories are created, the most stupid ones. In other words, if you are a sound human being who is interested to learn and grow or do some challenging work- please DO NOT join 1E, no matter how much you are lured. It's all a trap."

review,No visibility of future ..Slow growth rate in india market
review,"Research and Development opportunities aren't good, the work culture is pathetic, the management has no ethics and values, people aren't competitive, employees just laze around the entire time leading to extremely slow execution of tasks. Being a great MNC, the expectations run very high but this organisation, especially the offices in India are far from efficient. It's just a big name with no work ethics. My encounter with the organisation was awful during my internship. My peers and I didn't even get our internship completion certificates yet (it has been an year), that's the state of management and HR. Highly insensitive management!"

Your Idea's are always heard and acted upon by the management to enhance the product and the environment of the Company as a whole. Employees are provided with challenging task to be performed with the latest technologies in the market. Professional and personal grooming of an individual is taken care by the management, so as to improve the team building, and intellect of the employees to address the challenges ahead in life.I got an opportunity to directly work under the guidance of Mr. Sachin Mehra (CEO), he provided me ample amount of peripheries to work. Directly interactions with the national and International Clients. the best part was he was always there to assist you to overcome the all the odds to accomplish the things.To summarize I would say a very good company to work for an individual who is willing to learn and apply his learning in the enhancement of the company and himself.

The company has all the proper policies in place and they are posted on the intranet for everyone to see. Company use HR system online and provide detailed employee handbook on Intranet.

If you are thinking of joining, the most probable reason for it would be the sweet fake discussion done by CEO or you are like them probably former PATNI employee who is used to treat hell as heaven.However, CEO always try to keep his words, he plays two fold games if you are wise enough to understand. He never takes anything on his own shoulders but uses other pawns when it comes to attack.They have very few good clients who are working on new ideas but are not the best players in the marketIt might be good for freshers as they will learn the worst thing in their start of their career.

However, nothing could replace actual projects. So if you are planning to progress, forget this company. If you want to sit it out here and get some money deposited in your bank account every month, this company is for you.- Groupism. All those comments about the company being 'friendly' are made by people who are quite established in a friend circle. Introverts stand no chance here."

Will never     focus on your achievements but your mistakes.7) Cheap bond policy.8) You have to work 9: 30 every day.9) You have to mention break timing every day like you are in the school not in a software company.If you have experience is  more than 2 years please don't join this company.and If you  are fresher and don't have any option then only go for it."

noreview," A joint effort of the VH1 cable network and TV Guide magazine, this five-part series offered a countdown of the 100 greatest musical moments ever telecast. Each episode offered 20 of those moments on a descending scale (i.e. 100-81, 80-61, etc.). Among the highlights, represented via film and video excerpts and eyewitness recollections, were the creation of MTV, Michael Jackson's ""Moonwalk,"" Britney Spears' first appearance on Star Search, the debuts of such musically oriented series as The Monkees and The Sonny and Cher Show, and even such celebrated disasters as Mariah Carey's ""strip meltdown"" on Total Request Live. The same list appeared both on VH1 and in the pages of TV Guide, though there were a few discrepancies in the rankings. For example, while VH1 had once rated the Beatles' American debut on The Ed Sullivan Show as the number one TV musical event of all time, TV Guide superseded this with Bill Clinton's saxophone solo on The Arsenio Hall Show. The VH1 version of 100 Moments That Rocked TV ran for five consecutive evenings, beginning January 13, 2003."

noreview," This series chronicles the adventures--in the air and on the ground--of the men of the 918th Bombardment Group of the U.S. Eighth Air Force. First commanded by irascible General Frank Savage--and later by Colonel Joe Gallagher, the son of a Pentagon General--the Group is stationed in England, and flies long-range bombing missions into German-held Europe. This story is based not-to-loosely upon the real experiences of the crew of Frenesi, captained by William ""Pappy"" Cely, flying out of Rougham Field, Bury St Andrews. Though the sketch in general is a composite of any B-17's crew at the time, there are unarguable parallels to the Frenesi story, specifically, the mission to Brunswick on 2/11/44. Cely and his crew flew an inordinate number of missions; more certainly than the required 25. Cely flew Frenesi and her crew on this critical mission to bomb a ball bearing factory in Brunswick this day. The formation received heavier than usual flak and suffered gravely. Upon approaching target, dense, but intermittent low fog made dispatch questionable and the SOP would have been let fly and high tail it, but Pappy opted for a go-round, and re-approach to minimize collaterals. There was a school, see. Well Frenesi took a lot of heat; she was very badly damaged, but she was rewarded with a break in the fog to allow her to precisely dispense her load. She rattled back to Rougham, held together by her skin alone; her structure being later deemed ""the most heavily damaged bird to safely land"". She was a miracle, and Cely a saint."
noreview," Captain Dula is assigned as a pilot to the 918th, and in only his second mission, his plane is shot down with the loss of his entire crew. This earns him a reputation as a jinx, and Gallagher restricts him to non-pilot duties. On a subsequent mission, Dula takes umbrage at critical remarks from Komansky. When Gallagher and Stovall are wounded, Dula takes over the piloting and gives Komansky an order which he ignores while trying to save Stovall. Dula demands that an entry be made to the log noting Komansky's ""mutiny"". Later, Komansky comes into possession of a letter from another survivor of Dula's previous mission who is in a POW camp in Germany that implies that the captain abandoned his crew and plane without warning. He shows Dula the letter, after which he tries to play down his log entry. On their next mission, however, Komansky is seriously hurt, and his very survival may be in Dula's hands."
noreview," Frustrated by heavily overcast skies that make precision bombing impossible, the Allies are at wit's end, until Dr. Rink arrives with a new, top secret technology enabling them to ""see"" through the clouds: airborne radar. The first missions employing the device are wildly successful, especially since the Germans cannot effectively intercept the bombers with fighters or anti-aircraft because of the cloud cover. Unfortunately, the Germans quickly devise a counter-measure that actually uses the signals from the device to trace the bombers, allowing them to pinpoint the Americans with deadly accuracy. Only Dr. Rink has the knowledge to turn the tables once again, but he is virtually catatonic at the apparent failure of his technology."
noreview," As part of a brand new strategy called ""shuttle bombing"", the 918th lands in North Africa at the end of the first leg of the flight seriously short on fuel. Unfortunately, they are forced to use an airfield that has only just been liberated from the Germans by a motley group of Allied units commanded, by chance, by Col. Gallagher's older brother, Preston. Now the Nazis are determined to take the field back in a massive counterattack. Not only are Preston's forces badly outnumbered and out-gunned, but he is suffering from battle fatigue and on the verge of a breakdown. To make matters worse, he has commandeered his brother's fuel for his own plan to retreat, leaving Joe's planes and his mission in grave danger. Nearing the end of the first leg of the Shuttle Raid, Col. Joe Gallagher's aircraft runs low on fuel. As the nearest runway at Nenwadi is rained out and in deep mud, and the balance of Gallagher's group has moved on to Magadar, he decides to push his plane 100 miles further and join the rest of his group. On the ground at Magadar, Gallagher finds his brother, Preston, in command. Gallagher is puzzled by the strange behavior of his brother and learns from Lt. Col. Frank Bailey that Preston blames the obvious landing of Col. Gallagher's planes for the subsequent German attacks and loss of his men. Consequently, Preston wants to take the gasoline from the planes and use it to move his trucks, tanks and jeeps. Preston also plans to blow up Col. Gallagher's planes since they are useless without fuel."

Young Mellon admits he was torn up from his best friend's dying on the prior mission, but Savage points to evidence that Luftwaffe flak wiped out Mellon's sight on the second attack. Is Savage just covering his mistake, or giving Mellon and the tactic a deserved second chance ?"

This time, however, the turn-around base is in Russia, a determined but wary ally in the war against the Nazis. The situation becomes dangerously complicated when a Russian observer plane, piloted by a highly decorated Soviet hero, is accidentally shot down by one of the American bombers on the first leg of the mission. The suspicious commander of the Russian base refuses to release the supplies Gallagher needs to make the return flight until the man responsible for the act is identified. In the meantime, the Germans have pinpointed the location of the base, and are slaughtering the 918th with waves of air attacks as it sits helplessly on the ground. The situation only becomes more muddled as Gallagher discovers the overzealous shooter was the Soviet liaison who hitched a ride with the Group."

noreview,it's got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother ( william this time ) in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on . 
noreview,"going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there , virus still feels very empty , like a movie going for all flash and no substance . "
noreview,"we don't know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere , we don't know the origin of what took over the ship ( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir ) , and , of course , we don't know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout . "
noreview,"here , it's just "" hey , let's chase these people around with some robots "" . "
noreview,"the acting is below average , even from the likes of curtis . "
noreview,you're more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20 . 
noreview,"sutherland is wasted and baldwin , well , he's acting like a baldwin , of course . "
noreview,"the real star here are stan winston's robot design , some schnazzy cgi , and the occasional good gore shot , like picking into someone's brain . "
noreview,"so , if robots and body parts really turn you on , here's your movie . "
noreview,"otherwise , it's pretty much a sunken ship of a movie . "
noreview,"one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . "
noreview,what's the deal ? 
noreview,"watch the movie and "" sorta "" find out . . . "
noreview,"critique : a mind-fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . "
noreview,"which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just didn't snag this one correctly . "
noreview,"they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . "
noreview,so what are the problems with the movie ? 
noreview,"well , its main problem is that it's simply too jumbled . "
noreview,"it starts off "" normal "" but then downshifts into this "" fantasy "" world in which you , as an audience member , have no idea what's going on . "
noreview,"there are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained . "
noreview,"now i personally don't mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film's biggest problem . "
noreview,"it's obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes . "
noreview,"and do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ? "
noreview,not really . 
noreview,"the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half-way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still didn't the make the film all that more entertaining . "
noreview,"i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is "" into it "" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding . "
noreview,"i mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! ! "
noreview,"okay , we get it . . . there "
noreview,are people chasing her and we don't know who they are . 
noreview,do we really need to see it over and over again ? 
noreview,how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ? 
noreview,"apparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows . "
noreview,"there might've been a pretty decent teen mind-fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess "" the suits "" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense . "
noreview,"the actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood . "
noreview,"but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character's unraveling . "
noreview,"overall , the film doesn't stick because it doesn't entertain , it's confusing , it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it . "
noreview,"oh , and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . . it's "
noreview,just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids . 
noreview,it also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since .
noreview,it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch . 
noreview,"based on the late 1960's television show by the same name , the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover . "
noreview,"however , things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion . "
noreview,"of course , the ads make it seem like so much more . "
noreview,"quick cuts , cool music , claire dane's nice hair and cute outfits , car chases , stuff blowing up , and the like . "
noreview,"sounds like a cool movie , does it not ? "
noreview,"after the first fifteen minutes , it quickly becomes apparent that it is not . "
noreview,"the mod squad is certainly a slick looking production , complete with nice hair and costumes , but that simply isn't enough . "
noreview,"the film is best described as a cross between an hour-long cop show and a music video , both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half . "
noreview,and with it comes every single clich ? . 
noreview,"it doesn't really matter that the film is based on a television show , as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything we've already seen . "
noreview,"the characters and acting is nothing spectacular , sometimes even bordering on wooden . "
noreview,"claire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored , which really transfers onto the audience . "
noreview,"the only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi , who plays the resident crazy man , ultimately being the only thing worth watching . "
noreview,"unfortunately , even he's not enough to save this convoluted mess , as all the characters don't do much apart from occupying screen time . "
noreview,"with the young cast , cool clothes , nice hair , and hip soundtrack , it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset . "
noreview,"despite an american 'r' rating ( which the content does not justify ) , the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset . "
noreview,"information on the characters is literally spoon-fed to the audience ( would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us ? ) , dialogue is poorly written , and the plot is extremely predictable . "
noreview,"the way the film progresses , you likely won't even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy , because you'll know they aren't . "
noreview,"basing the show on a 1960's television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom , especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand ( even one that's missing a finger or two ) . "
noreview,the number of times that i checked my watch ( six ) is a clear indication that this film is not one of them . 
noreview,"it is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar , judging from the rash of really awful teen-flicks that we've been seeing as of late . "
noreview,avoid this film at all costs . 
noreview,"this year , it's no contest , as "" quest for camelot "" is pretty much dead on arrival . "
noreview,"even the magic kingdom at its most mediocre -- that'd be "" pocahontas "" for those of you keeping score -- isn't nearly as dull as this . "
noreview,"the story revolves around the adventures of free-spirited kayley ( voiced by jessalyn gilsig ) , the early-teen daughter of a belated knight from king arthur's round table . "
noreview,"kayley's only dream is to follow in her father's footsteps , and she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber ( gary oldman ) , an ex-round table member-gone-bad , steals arthur's magical sword excalibur and accidentally loses it in a dangerous , booby-trapped forest . "
noreview,"with the help of hunky , blind timberland-dweller garrett ( carey elwes ) and a two-headed dragon ( eric idle and don rickles ) that's always arguing with itself , kayley just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold and prove her worth as a fighter on arthur's side . "
noreview,"unsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman's favor , he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way . "
noreview,"comments : stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video . "
noreview,"their proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they're typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television ) . "
noreview,"stalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary , he's rejected rather quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband ) . "
noreview,"other than that , stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable . "
noreview,"stalked does not provide much suspense , though that is what it sets out to do . "
noreview,"interspersed throughout the opening credits , for instance , a serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk ( it's implicitly implied that all stalkers are men ) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen . "
noreview,"after these credits , a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears . "
noreview,"the narrator states that "" this is the story of daryl gleason "" and tells the audience that he is the stalker . "
noreview,"of course , really , this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels . "
noreview,"if the movie was meant to be about daryl , then it should have been called stalker not stalked . "
noreview,okay . so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts ; no guesswork required . 
noreview,"stalked proceeds , then , as it begins : obvious , obvious , obvious . "
noreview,"the opening sequence , contrived quite a bit , brings daryl and brooke ( the victim ) together . "
noreview,"daryl obsesses over brooke , follows her around , and tries to woo her . "
noreview,"ultimately rejected by her , his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate . "
noreview,"these plans include the all-time , psycho-in-love , cliche : the murdered pet . "
noreview,"for some reason , this genre's films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked . "
noreview,stalked is no exception ( it's a cat this time -- found in the shower ) . 
noreview,"events like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked , where only one survives ( guess who it invariably always is and you'll guess the conclusion to this turkey ) . "
noreview,stalked's cast is uniformly adequate : not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either . 
noreview,"jay underwood , as the stalker , turns toward melodrama a bit too much . "
noreview,"he overdoes it , in other words , but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands . "
noreview,"maryam d'abo , about the only actor close to being a star here ( she played the bond chick in the living daylights ) , is equally adequate as the "" stalked "" of the title , even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong , independent business-owner . "
noreview,"brooke ( d'abo ) needs to be ditzy , however , for the plot to proceed . "
noreview,"toward the end , for example , brooke has her suspicions about daryl . "
noreview,"to ensure he won't use it as another excuse to see her , brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house . "
noreview,does she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers ? 
noreview,of course not . 
noreview,"she tries the door , opens it , and wanders around the house . "
noreview,"when daryl returns , he enters the house , of course , so our heroine is in danger . "
noreview,"somehow , even though her car is parked at the front of the house , right by the front door , daryl is oblivious to her presence inside . "
noreview,the whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience's suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either character's intelligence . 
noreview,"stalked receives two stars because , even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring , it is not so bad that it cannot be watched . "
noreview,"rated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar , it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are . "
noreview,"if you're in the mood for a good suspense film , though , stake out something else . "
noreview,john carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes . 
noreview,"for a writer and director of horror films , supposedly an expert on horror , it is a very bad mistake to make . "
noreview,"ghosts of mars is called a horror movie , but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low-powered alien menace . "
noreview,"in addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars , carpenter would have grounds to sue . "
noreview,"this film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13 , the thing , and prince of darkness . "
noreview,"it is , in fact , surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way . "
noreview,but that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience . 
noreview,ghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176 . 
noreview,mars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear ( which is good for the film's budget ) . 
noreview,"it is never mentioned , but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth-normal , again making it easier to film . "
noreview,"society has changed a bit by that time , but it has advanced surprisingly little . "
noreview,apparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control . 
noreview,"and from carpenter's view , women have really made a mess of things . "
noreview,society has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten . 
noreview,"the basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9 ( yes , precinct 9 ) has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony . "
noreview,"instead of having the criminal "" napolean "" wilson , this film has the criminal "" desolation "" williams . "
noreview,"instead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face , well , ghosts of mars . "
noreview,"because the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner , but they essentially behave as human savages , in another lapse of imagination . "
noreview,"the story is told in flashback , flashback within flashback , and flashback within flashback within flashback . "
noreview,"ghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red , yellow , and black . "
noreview,"carpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene , showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat . "
noreview,sadly what follows is not really up to the buildup . 
noreview,the terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss . 
noreview,his idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring . 
noreview,these are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience . 
noreview,somewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights . 
noreview,"within a short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars , red planet , and ghosts of mars . "
noreview,after mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by . 
noreview,i rate ghosts of mars a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 
noreview,"following the movie i showed my wife , who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than i did , carpenter's classic assault on precinct 13 . "
noreview,her comment is that it was seeing the same film twice . 
noreview,"so ask yourself what "" 8mm "" ( "" eight millimeter "" ) is really all about . "
noreview,"is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy , sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography ? "
noreview,"is it about the business itself , how , bubbling just beneath the surface of big-town americana , there's a sordid world of sick and depraved people who won't necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires ? "
noreview,"or is it about those who can , those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see ? "
noreview,"i'm not talking about snuff films , supposed "" documentaries "" of victims being brutalized and killed on camera . "
noreview,"i'm talking about films like "" 8mm "" and its director , joel schumacher . "
noreview,"with a recent run of big budget movies to his credit-- "" batman & robin , "" "" a time to kill , "" "" batman forever , "" "" the client "" --schumacher certainly has that kind of influence . "
noreview,"is "" 8mm "" something you really want to see ? "
noreview,probably not . 
noreview,"the first two-thirds of "" 8mm "" unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama , albeit with a particularly unsavory core . "
noreview,"then , as it's been threatening all along , the film explodes into violence . "
noreview,"and just when you think it's finally over , schumacher tags on a ridiculous self-righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further . "
noreview,trust me . 
noreview,there are better ways to waste two hours of your life . 
noreview,"nicolas ' "" snake eyes "" ' cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husband's safe documents a young girl's murder . "
noreview,"welles goes about his assignment rather matter-of-factly , and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly , almost as if you don't need any specialized skills or training to do this . "
noreview,welles certainly makes it look easy . 
noreview,"and cops , obviously , never look in toilet tanks for clues . "
noreview,"the deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes , like george c . scott in paul schrader's "" hardcore . "" "
noreview,"occasionally , a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector , reminding him of his unpleasant task . "
noreview,"there are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife , played by catherine keener , who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly split-level home in harrisburg , pa . "
noreview,that's exactly how long the movie felt to me . 
noreview,there weren't even nine laughs in nine months . 
noreview,"it's a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man , mr . hugh grant , a huge dork . "
noreview,"it's not the whole oral-sex/prostitution thing ( referring to grant , not me ) that bugs me , it's the fact that grant is annoying . "
noreview,"not just adam sandler-annoying , we're talking jim carrey-annoying . "
noreview,since when do eye flutters and nervous smiles pass for acting ? 
noreview,"but , on the other hand , since when do really bad slapstick ( a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant's head in joan cusack's lap--a scene he paid $60 to have included in the movie ) and obscene double entendres ( robin williams , the obstetrician , tells grant's pregnant girlfriend she has "" a big pussy , "" referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat , but nonetheless , grant paid $60 to have the exchange included in the movie ) pass for comedy ? "
noreview,nine months is a predictable cookie-cutter movie with no originality in humor or plot . 
noreview,hugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist . 
noreview,why a child psychologist ? 
noreview,so the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange : 
noreview,kid : my dad's an asshole . 
noreview,"grant ( flutters eyelashes , offers a nervous smile , then responds in his annoying english accent and i-think-i-actually-have- talent attitude ) : could you possibly elaborate on that ? "
noreview,kid : my dad's a _huge_ asshole . 
noreview,"more like a hugh asshole , but that's beside the point , which is : nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that get laughs from the ten year olds in the audience while everyone else shakes his or her head in disbelief . "
noreview,"so , anyway , grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant and does his usual reaction ( fluttered eyelashes , nervous smiles ) . "
noreview,"this paves the way for every possible pregnancy/child birth gag in the book , especially since grant's equally annoying friend's wife is also pregnant . "
noreview,"the annoying friend is played by tom arnold , who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick , none of which is funny , such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed "" arnie the dinosaur "" ( you draw your own parallels on that one ) in a toy store . "
noreview,"the only interesting character in the movie is played by jeff goldblum , who should have hid himself away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway , as an artist with a fear of ( and simultaneous longing for ) commitment . "
noreview,"not even robin williams , who plays a russian doctor who has recently decided to switch from veterinary medicine to obstetrics , has much humor . "
noreview,his is a one-joke character-- the old foreign-guy-who-mispronounces-english stereotype ( did someone say yakov smirnov ? 
noreview,"that's my favorite vodka , by the way ) , hence the line "" now it's time to take a look at your volvo , "" another nasty but unamusing joke , except this one goes right over the ten year olds' heads , while the adults simultaneously groan . "
noreview,"nine months is a complete failure , low on laughs and intelligence and high on loud , unfunny slapstick , failed jokes and other uninspired lunacy . "
noreview,"hugh grant's sunset boulevard arrest ( please , no caught-with-his-pants-down jokes ) may bring more people into the theaters , but they certainly won't leave with a smile on their faces , not after 90 minutes of grant's nervous smiles . "
noreview,"everything in the movie is so forced , so unauthentic that anyone with an i . q . "
noreview,"over 80 ( sorry , hugh ) will know they wasted their money on an unfulfilled desire . "
noreview,but at least they didn't spend 60 bucks for it .

review,"Where do I start? It\'s a job where you have no idea what you are doing as a copywriter, what your managers want and what the client wants. It\'s a hopeless process, more of a pressure cooker. They are hiring like crazy because the attrition rate is so high. Old Hibu people as well as new comers are leaving the company because it really sucks. There is no scope for growth and no scope for creativity as a writer. Join this place only if money matters to you the most. These people make you work 10 hours straight and track every second of your productivity in office. You can\'t rake more than 45 minutes of break. They expect you to work as dogs. They make you work on Saturdays in the name of ""business requirement"". It\'s a clueless bunch of people managing the pet project of the client. Mind you the client is super arrogant who makes the lives of the managers hell, which means that your life will be screwed by the Managers in the name of the client."
review,"Hibu has been taken over by TCs and currently the policies have been implemented. 3 Months Notice.10 Hours workThe attrition seems to be very very high and to counter the same, 3 months notice has been implemented. This is againist HR Rules. Please scarp 10 hours work. This is unacceptable in any IT company in the World."
review,Very low pay. Contract employees are paid very low.
review,The rapid expansion of the company over  30 countries brings with it the challenges of uniformly applying best practices at the pace envisaged.
review,The people working with you expect you treat them as GOD. Most of the people don't speak english and 80% people are only Malayalis only and if u speak in Hindi or English they will scold you in Malayalam and it was my own experience.

review,"worked there for two years in blr, but did not find any issues. so no cons."
noreview,call it a road trip for the walking wounded . 
noreview,"stellan skarsg ? rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it's difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly , boozed-out presence . "
noreview,"yet this ever-reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen , a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama . "
noreview,"playwright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets , unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late . "
noreview,"that's an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for , focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father , tomas ( skarsg ? rd ) and his alienated , openly hostile yuppie daughter , kaisa ( lena headey , gossip ) . "
noreview,"they haven't spoken in years , and wouldn't even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen , scotland by automobile if it weren't for kaisa's mother ( charlotte rampling , under the sand ) rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer . "
noreview,"in a soap opera twist , mother has only a few days to live . "
noreview," ( only in the movies , right ? ) "
noreview,"too blitzed to even step foot on a plane , tomas hits the open road with kaisa . "
noreview,"loathing each other all the while , they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out -- whenever he isn't muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be . "
noreview,"despite his sloshed viewpoint , tomas recognizes that the apple hasn't fallen very far from the tree . "
noreview,"kaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke , sabotages her personal relationships through indifference , and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper . "
noreview,ain't they a pair ? 
noreview,"unable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one-note and repetitively bitchy dialogue , screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward -- lost money , roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around , nosy cops , and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative . "
noreview,"by the time they reach the hospital , it's time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father-daughter conflict , they're also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe . "
noreview,this revelation exists purely for its own sake . 
noreview,aberdeen doesn't know where else to go . 
noreview,"weak , unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa . "
noreview,"if lena headey were a stronger actress , perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody , haunting cinematography ( rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world -- the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional ) . "
noreview,"headey's too busy acting , using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance . "
noreview,"if she were paying any attention to skarsg ? rd , maybe she'd figure out that doing less can reveal so much more . "
noreview,"it's worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 , jonathan nossiter's captivating signs & wonders . "
noreview,it's not just because skarsg ? rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films ( they're not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen ) . 
noreview,the differences in the way their characters were presented is significant . 
noreview,"in aberdeen , rampling is a luminous diva , preening and static in her hospital bed . "
noreview,"despite skarsg ? rd's solid performance as tomas , his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow . "
noreview,"there's genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs & wonders , allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity . "
noreview,nossiter's film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain . 
noreview,"if signs & wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas , at least it's willing to stretch beyond what we've come to expect from traditional drama . "
noreview,"aberdeen is never half so ambitious , content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies . "
noreview,when did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life ? 
noreview,"the depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdan's trite but occasionally useful grand canyon , where steve martin's hollywood mogul pronounces , "" all of life's riddles are answered in the movies ! "" "
noreview,even foreign films are taking that advice to heart . 
noreview,"best remembered for his understated performance as dr . hannibal lecter in michael mann's forensics thriller , manhunter , scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on . "
noreview,"usually playing a bit role in some studio schlock ( he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight ) , he's only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do . "
noreview,"if you want to see some brilliant acting , check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach's hidden agenda . "
noreview,"cox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l . i . e . , which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge . "
noreview,"big john feels the love that dares not speak its name , but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad . "
noreview,what bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light . 
noreview,"he's an even-tempered , funny , robust old man who actually listens to the kids' problems ( as opposed to their parents and friends , both caught up in the high-wire act of their own confused lives . ) "
noreview,"he'll have sex-for-pay with them only after an elaborate courtship , charming them with temptations from the grown-up world . "
noreview,"l . i . e . stands for long island expressway , which slices through the strip malls and middle-class homes of suburbia . "
noreview,"filmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a ( pretty transparent ) metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15-year old protagonist , howie ( paul franklin dano ) . "
noreview,"in his opening voice-over , howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road , citing the l . i . e . "
noreview,"highway deaths of filmmaker alan j . pakula , songwriter harry chapin , and his own mother on exit 52 . "
noreview,"he's both fascinated and disturbed by the l . i . e . , and those feelings are projected onto big john ( who follows howie around in his bright red car , but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesn't want to do . "
noreview,"this makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies -- he's a beast , but ashamed of it . ) "
noreview,l . i . e . would have worked best as a half-hour short film about howie's ill-advised foray into big john's haven . 
noreview,"there is unnecessary padding with howie's miserable dad ( bruce altman ) in the hot seat for a white-collar crime , degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle-class houses , and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise-ass gary terrio ( billy kay ) , a handsome artful dodger . "
noreview,"rather than add to the themes of suburban ennui ( not that we needed another movie on that subject ) , these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length . "
noreview,"concurrently , the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted . "
noreview,"cox , sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo , is all bluff and bluster . "
noreview,dano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent . 
noreview,"we're so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious ( calling haley joel ! ) , it's surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene . "
noreview,the restraint is admirable . 
noreview,but l . i . e . 's screenplay doesn't always give them the best material . 
noreview,"when howie reads big john a walt whitman poem , the moment feels a bit too precious . "
noreview,"director michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john , who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach's goldberg variations . "
noreview,it's too much . 
noreview,"there are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john's other boy toy ( walter masterson ) , jealous over the newbie . "
noreview,this plot thread predictably leads to violence . 
noreview,"not content to be a haunting , observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world ( like terry zwigoff's superb ghost world ) , cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note . "
noreview,"it's typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet , sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex , philosophical note . "
noreview,"in this regard , l . i . e . "
noreview, ( and countless other indie films ) share something in common with blockbuster action films : problems are solved when the obstacle is removed . 
noreview,how often does real life work this way ? 
noreview,"to extend the question : if a movie is striving for realism , do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion ? "
noreview,janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy -- it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker . 
noreview,this is a by-the-books movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs . 
noreview,"it also jumps on the ever-popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there , too . "
noreview,garofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator ( jay o . sanders ) running for reelection . 
noreview,denis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal- plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that's made the kennedy family so popular . 
noreview,so leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit . 
noreview,"she soon learns why "" easier said than done "" is the mantra of movies like this . "
noreview,"the matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong -- garofalo has to take a tiny plane to ireland , almost misses the bus to town , can't get a hotel room , ends up in the smallest , trashiest one around , has a dog piss on her luggage , and so on . "
noreview,"then comes what roger ebert calls the "" meet cute . "" "
noreview,"it happens in every romance : the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional , cinematic way . "
noreview,"in the matchmaker , it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds a nude sean ( david o'hara ) in the bathtub , his dog sitting at his side . "
noreview,no points for guessing it's the same dog that just made water on her luggage . 
noreview,also no points for guessing garofalo hates o'hara on sight . 
noreview,that's how it works in movies like these . 
noreview,"i know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that she'd hate him for awhile , then succumb to his charms , live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil , after which they'd reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits . "
noreview,i haven't mentioned the movie's twist yet . 
noreview,"garofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival , during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss . "
noreview,milo o'shea ( who looks like an irish tom snyder ) is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together . 
noreview,rest assured he'll do all he can to match up garofalo and o'hara . 
noreview,"oh , and in keeping with the matchmaker's utter predictability , he dies toward the end . "
noreview,what the message here ? 
noreview,"sometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction , like garofalo , will sell out with a weak script . "
noreview,"i was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie , but they actually only have two or three scenes together . "
noreview,"leary stays stateside , for the most part , yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole . "
noreview,he even undoes himself with the old microphone's still on after he's done giving the speech cliche . 
noreview,both of them should have known better . 
noreview,"and now the high-flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics , and it isn't pretty . "
noreview,"this time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer , a version of dumas's the three musketeers . "
noreview,by bringing in popular asian actor/stunt coordinator xing xing xiong -- whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez -- our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting . 
noreview,the end result is a tepid and dull action/adventure rip-off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu . 
noreview,the story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay . 
noreview,d'artagnan ( justin chambers ) is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer . 
noreview,he travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents . 
noreview,"in paris , he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu ( stephen rea ) , who is trying to overthrow the king , and richelieu's man-in-black associate febre ( tim roth ) , the killer of his folks . "
noreview,"he finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk , so he rounds up aramis ( nick moran ) , athos ( jan gregor kremp ) and porthos ( steven spiers ) to free the musketeer's wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king's prison . "
noreview,"d'artagnan and his new frisky love interest/chambermaid francesca ( mena suvari ) play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen ( catherine deneuve ) ends up being captured by the menancing febre , forcing the musketeers to regroup , with d'artagnan leading the charge , and save the day . "
noreview,"director peter hyams ( end of days ) obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles , but here it's a disaster . "
noreview,"one problem is that , in reality , most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones . "
noreview,jet li's high risk is a rip-off of die hard -- not the other way around . 
noreview,"ironically , there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all -- maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes . "
noreview,"most asian action films carry the bulk of their production with 20- to 30-minute action sequences , because they know the scenes have to carry the picture . "
noreview,"the musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano ( sudden death ) , horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth , and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers ( the wedding planner ) to deliver his mousy self as a leader . "
noreview,chambers' d'artangnan isn't a musketeer -- he's a mouseketeer ! 
noreview,"and hyam's use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are well-noted , but that's the only standout in an overall flat production . "
noreview,a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels . 
noreview,"first , there's the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie . "
noreview,"but occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery . "
noreview,no no . . . 
noreview,just kidding . 
noreview,"had you going there for a moment , didn't i ? "
noreview,"in all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games . "
noreview,the first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it's 5 billion inhabitants ) . 
noreview,"the mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth . "
noreview,"unfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance . "
noreview,the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game . 
noreview,i'd even go so far as to say that many folks who didn't know about the game probably enjoyed the movie . 
noreview,"the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn't try to overachieve . "
noreview,"there were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot . "
noreview,"and , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office . "
noreview,"mortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie . "
noreview,"shao khan has decided that he's going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament . "
noreview,"thereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid . "
noreview,"one gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought "" hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . "" "
noreview,too bad they didn't simply stick with the formula from the first movie . 
noreview,"i could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : "
noreview, * the acting is truly bad . 
noreview,"sandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) . "
noreview," * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i've * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder . "
noreview,"in the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics . "
noreview,"i generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim "" tiny "" lister , jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite "" utility "" actors but he's so totally wrong for this part that he doesn't even have the luxury of amused self-awareness . "
noreview," * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again . "
noreview," * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) . "
noreview,"for these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . . "
noreview, . . . unless you're a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie . 
noreview,"in that case , the following critiques also apply : "
noreview," * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter . "
noreview,wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer . 
noreview,"hess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene . "
noreview," * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) . "
noreview,"sonya does her "" kiss of death , "" jax does his "" earthquake , "" liu kang does his "" animality , "" and so on . "
noreview,a big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely . 
noreview," * there aren't as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first , because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between . "
noreview,"silly , silly folks . "
noreview,and the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match . 
noreview,"lame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it . "
noreview," * the special effects are generally better , except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their "" animalities . "" "
noreview,motaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie . 
noreview,"for folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games , i give this a 5 . "
noreview,"you'll probably like it , but not nearly as much as you liked the first one . "
noreview,"she was the femme in "" la femme nikita . "" "
noreview,"he was the baldwin in "" backdraft , "" "" sliver , "" and "" fair game "" ( with cindy crawford ) . "
noreview,"together , anne parillaud and william baldwin conspire to make "" shattered image "" the biggest piece of hooey since the stallone/stone "" thriller "" "" the specialist . "" "
noreview,"the film poses the question "" what if the life you're living now is really a dream , and your dreams reality ? "" "
noreview,"it's either about a woman who's haunted by a recurring ( and recurring and recurring ) nightmare that she's a hired assassin , or it's about a hired assassin who's haunted by a recurring ( and recurring and recurring ) nightmare that she's honeymooning with william baldwin in jamaica . "
noreview,"it doesn't much matter and believe me by the time "" shattered image "" runs its painful and pedestrian course you won't care . "
noreview,"these two lives , with parillaud looking like siouxsie sioux with a black wig , black emotionless eyes , and black leather clothing in the seattle-based assassin scenes , and moping around like karen carpenter in the jamaica scenes , play out endlessly throughout the film and the result is it's now * twice * as boring as it might have been . "
noreview,it's not that complicated plots can't be entertaining . 
noreview,"of course it helps if you have interesting characters , crisp dialogue , and a modicum of style . "
noreview,that's parillaud's character talking . . . 
noreview,to her cat ! 
noreview,and : 
noreview, you're not the reason i couldn't care less about you .  
noreview,huh ? 
noreview,and this wonderful bathroom interchange early in the film : 
noreview, if you give me a couple of minutes you know i'll charm the pants off you .  
noreview, i don't have that kind of time .  
noreview,"talking of pants , parillaud has her clothes off faster than you can say "" point of no return . "" "
noreview,"we have come to expect this from billy baldwin , but it might have been nice to have learned something about their characters first . "
noreview,but there's nothing to learn . 
noreview,"karen is as interesting as a cereal box , a someone's-out-to-get-me crybaby who imagines the voice at the other end of the phone , the stranger who sends her flowers , maybe even her husband himself , is her would-be killer . "
noreview,"siouxsie is the chromium cool , tough-as-nails crack killing machine who shoots out a couple of mirrors in order to justify the film's meaningless stock title . "
noreview,baldwin seems more interested in parillaud's nest egg ( so that he can pave paradise and put up a parking lot ) than he does in her . 
noreview,each time graham greene shows up he gets killed . 
noreview,"barbet schroeder ( "" reversal of fortune "" ) co-produced and should be ashamed of himself . "
noreview,every now and again it's fun to watch a really bad movie . 
noreview,"and every now and again , as "" shattered image "" makes agonizingly clear , it isn't . "
noreview,i'm really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone . 
noreview,"sure , she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god's green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy ) , but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in , she always strikes out . "
noreview,"the crush was a slow-moving , predictable piece of fluff . "
noreview,hideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in . 
noreview,"clueless was an annoying , unfunny waste of time . "
noreview,"and people have e-mailed me too , saying clueless is a good movie and that i'm the only one who doesn't like it . "
noreview,"one girl said if i'd seen the movie with "" an open mind , "" i would have enjoyed it . "
noreview,nothing could be further from the truth . 
noreview,i went into the theater expecting to love the movie . 
noreview,"the preview looked good and of course i'm crazymadinlove with alicia , but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny , unlikable characters . "
noreview,almost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way . 
noreview,"when we were walking out of the theater , one guy ( and it wasn't me ) yelled out , "" that was the worst f$&#in' movie i've ever seen "" and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement . "
noreview,so last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia's pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called the babysitter . 
noreview,i knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i'll probably never understand made me rent it anyway . 
noreview,what i got was 90 minutes of regret--the worst alicia silverstone movie ever . 
noreview,and you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like . 
noreview,where to begin in criticizing this movie ? 
noreview,"the plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier , the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old , alicia is the star and she's still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever . "
noreview,"there is zero humor , zero suspense , zero drama and zero action , until the last ten minutes , when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence . "
noreview,zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero . 
noreview,so why does this movie get one star out of me ? 
noreview,"well , alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub . "
noreview,"and if it wasn't bubble bath , the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four- star features , but you settle for what you can get . "
noreview,alicia plays a babysitter who's spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party . 
noreview,and of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home ( at least that movie critic at large guy does ) . 
noreview,"as the movie trods along , we discover she's not only the mostly-silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character's fantasies ( and probably every male viewer's too ) . "
noreview,"the drunken father thinks she's just the thing to recapture his lost youth , her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside , even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she's taking her bubble bath . "
noreview,they even throw in the middle aged wife's fantasies about a male counterpart at the party . 
noreview,not that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy . 
noreview,at least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg-rated . 
noreview,"in fact , i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late-night staple if not for the fact that there's absolutely no nudity in it . "
noreview,so you can't call it a sex flick . 
noreview,"i've already pointed out that it can't fall under drama , comedy , thriller or action , so what do you classify the babysitter as ? "
noreview,bad . 
noreview,"so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci-fi films such as close encounters of the third kind , 2001 : a space odyssey , apollo 13 and contact ? "
noreview,"well , whatever it is , you'd sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange , considering the disastrous results we're left with here . "
noreview,"this is a film that takes a little bit of everything , but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing ! "
noreview,it's like i said . . . this 
noreview,movie sucks . 
noreview,"plot : a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 , after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet . "
noreview,critique : extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie . 
noreview,"uneven , would be another . "
noreview,"the trailer for this movie actually showed some promise , the buzz around it had been so-so , and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes , all leading you to believe that it's actually going to go "" somewhere "" . "
noreview,"but it isn't long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral , features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry-colored planet , tries too hard to get us into the "" pain "" of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix . "
noreview,in a sci-fi movie ? 
noreview,"well , i don't know , much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half , only to figure out some big secret in the end , a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement . "
noreview,"ultimately , this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise , joins the crew in their "" misadventures in space "" for the main crux of its journey , and eventually settles down for one of the most anti-climactic endings this side of contact . "
noreview,"mind you , if you enjoyed that film's shrug-of-the-shoulders ending , you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well . "
noreview,"of course , i don't remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story . "
noreview,ugh . 
noreview,what a friggin' mess . 
noreview,films like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again . 
noreview,didn't anybody recognize the crappiness in this script ? 
noreview,"didn't they read the bad dialogue , the cheezy lines , the obvious derivative nature of the work ( mind you , with a director like depalma at the helm , that ain't saying much ! ) . "
noreview,"of course , you can't really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o'connell in this fine crew of thespians . "
noreview,'nuff said . 
noreview,"neither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film's musical score during the last fifteen minutes , presumably in order to wake the audience up ( okay , we get it brian , this scene is supposed to be powerful . . . wow . . . yawn . . . my "
noreview,ears hurt ! ) . 
noreview,so is anything salvageable in this movie ? 
noreview,sure . 
noreview,"gary sinise does another great job , as does cheadle , the film doesn't completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening , and yes , the "" sand-twister "" effect that you see in the commercial is well done . "
noreview,other than that ? 
noreview,"i guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies . . . oops , "
noreview,"did i say "" admire "" , i meant "" am disgusted "" ! "
noreview,"all in all , this movie delivers very little in actual substance , offers two-bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci-fi mumbo-jumbo , pretends to be deep when really it's just sappy , and eventually just settles into an ending which , other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story , gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck . "
noreview,go see the ninth gate . . . now 
noreview,there's a great movie ! 
noreview,"and on a personal note , i think it's time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12-minute uninterrupted film sequences , and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting . "
noreview,the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that the two leads must end up together by film's end . 
noreview,"if you're not familiar with this law , then maybe you've seen the trailer for this film which shows that the two leads are together by film's end . "
noreview,"now if you're a regular reader of mine , you've heard me say this countless times : you know how drive me crazy is going to end , but is the journey to get to that ending worth it ? "
noreview,"no , it definitely is not . "
noreview,"melissa joan hart ( from abc's "" sabrina , the teenage witch "" ) likes a hunky stud on the basketball team . "
noreview,adrien grenier is her grungy neighbor who's just broken up with his activist girlfriend . 
noreview,"apparently he wants to make his ex-girlfriend jealous enough to take him back , and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance . "
noreview,"so the two pretend to date for some reason , but only after hart gives grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud . "
noreview,will grenier like his new popularity and turn on his friends ? 
noreview,will this crazy scheme work ? 
noreview,do i care ? 
noreview,the teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprisingly good in terms of comedy . 
noreview,"what makes movies like can't hardly wait and 10 things i hate about you work ( and to a lesser extent , she's all that and never been kissed ) is because the writers of those films seem to realize that high school is a joke and write their scripts accordingly . "
noreview,i don't know what the writer's intention was with drive me crazy . 
noreview,there was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to . 
noreview,here there's nothing . . . 
noreview,just teens whining about who's going to take them to the big dance . 
noreview,"do me a favor kids , go get a job or something . . . "
noreview,just shut the hell up . 
noreview,"in all honesty , the best part of this film is the end credits . "
noreview,"now normally when i say that it's followed with the joke "" . . . because the movie is finally over . "" "
noreview,in this case though the end credits really are the most entertaining part of the film . 
noreview,"after the obligatory second playing of britney spears' titular song , there's a quick commercial jingle for a burger joint the kids in the film hang out in and a brief rendition of the school song for their high school . "
noreview,"nothing great , but more entertaining than anything in the 90 minutes which preceded them . "
noreview,"sci-fi fans take note : there are brief appearances from stephen collins ( star trek : the motion picture ) and faye grant ( the tv miniseries "" v "" and "" v : the final battle "" ) . "
noreview, . . . unless you're a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie . 
noreview,mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla . 
noreview,"his entrance , however , is a grand one : out from the trees he leaps , gargantuan and imposing , sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug , and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have . "
noreview,"joe bellows at the poachers before him , angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars . "
noreview,"during this scene , i turned to my friend and said , "" wow . "
noreview,"that's some ape . "" "
noreview,"joe is quite a gorilla -- a big , digital gorilla . "
noreview,"he runs around the fields , chasing cars and people . "
noreview,he picks things up and stares at them pensively . 
noreview,"he breaks things on accident , because he's just too big to avoid clumsiness . "
noreview,"joe , as a special effect , is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes . "
noreview,"as a character , he doesn't quite register . "
noreview,and the story he's been put in is as limp as they come . 
noreview,"the words "" family entertainment "" have never been a stamp of quality , but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart . "
noreview,the picture is a remake of the 1949 film . 
noreview,"it's mostly just about the big gorilla , but , strictly as a formality , the movie also has a few human characters . "
noreview,"the main one is jill young ( poor charlize theron , forced to waste her talent ) , a lover of gorillas . "
noreview,"as a child , she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother ; now , she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife . "
noreview,"specifically , she's out to protect joe , a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood . "
noreview,"soon , zoologist gregg o'hara ( bill paxton ) discovers joe ; he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser ( rade sherbedgia ) , who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill's mother . "
noreview,"so , in an effort to save joe , jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve , where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers . "
noreview,"in addition , the space is way too small for him ( after all , he is a really big gorilla ) . "
noreview,"and , to add to the complications , strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext ( he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe ) , and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill's mother . "
noreview,"jill , of course , doesn't recognize strasser , even though he did kill her mother . "
noreview,"this is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young , a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film . "
noreview,"the movie isn't really offensive -- it has some competent actors , a few nifty sets , and a lot of scenes with a big , digitized gorilla . "
noreview,"but the story is really dumb , there aren't any characters , and the film isn't satisfying on any level beyond its visuals . "
noreview,the movie also has bad dialogue . 
noreview,"if a critic says that a film has bad dialogue , it's only fair to quote some of it , but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like "" joe isn't happy ! "" "
noreview,"and "" joe isn't safe here ! "" "
noreview, we need to get joe out of here !  
noreview, joe is way too big for that cage !  
noreview,"i don't know if these phrases are word for word , but they're close . "
noreview,"as i said , the characters here are only present as a formality : they do little more than state the obvious ( of * course * joe is too big for that cage ) . "
noreview,paxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them . 
noreview,"sadly , mighty joe young wastes them both . "
noreview,"there are a few clever moments ( although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment ) , and , as i said , the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes . "
noreview,it's certainly not a bad film for kids ; i doubt joe will give them nightmares . 
noreview,but adults in the audience aren't likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla . 
noreview,"a big gorilla is only interesting for a little while ; after that , something needs to be done with the big gorilla . "
noreview,nobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla . 
noreview," spawn "" features good guys , bad guys , lots of fighting , bloody violence , a leather-clad machine gun chick , gooey , self-healing bullet holes , scatological humor and a man-eating monster . it not only appears to have been tailor made for a swarm of 12- and 13-year-old boys , it appears to have been made by them . in a classic example of telling and not showing , "" spawn "" opens with a truckload of mumbo jumbo about forces of darkness , forces of light and how "" men are the ones who create evil on earth .  "
noreview,so much for a message . 
noreview,"the movie then lurches forward into the plight of al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government assassin/operative who is murdered by diabolical boss jason wynn ( martin sheen , who plays all of his scenes like an oscar clip ) while on a top secret mission in a north korean biological weapons plant . "
noreview,"simmons goes to hell and back , after making a deal with satan himself -- if he agrees to command the devil's army to overtake the world , he'll be allowed to return to earth to see his wife wanda ( underused theresa randle ) and little girl cyan ( sydni beaudoin ) . "
noreview,"of course , seeing as how five years has passed , wanda has fallen for -- and married -- simmons' partner ( d . b . "
noreview,sweeney ) . 
noreview,"his , uh , shoulder to cry on comes in the form of clown ( john leguizamo ) , a disgustingly disproportioned minion of satan's . "
noreview,"clown manipulates simmons , now in superhuman spawn form , into a stand off with wynn . "
noreview,"wynn , who thinks he is in league with the double-dealing clown , recognizes spawn as a threat and undergoes an operation where a bomb is placed on his heart -- when it stops beating , major cities around the world will detonate , causing the leak of a disease that "" makes the ebola virus look like a skin rash . "" "
noreview,phew . got all that ? 
noreview,"it would be easy to dismiss "" spawn "" as just another one of those heavy-on-fx , short-on-substance action pics , but it doesn't even work on that level . "
noreview,"the computer-generated sequences are often and plenty , and the problem is that they look too computer-generated . "
noreview,the several scenes set in hell present a devil that looks and acts like a video game graphic -- with the movie's healthy budget you'd think they could have afforded to make his mouth move when he talks . 
noreview,"other elements of the movie are so-so ; spawn's enormous red , flowing cape is a wonderful sight , but it's too obvious when he's being played by a costumed actor or an image . "
noreview,"in movies like "" contact , "" the special effects serve the story . "
noreview,"in "" spawn , "" they are the story . "
noreview,and spawn himself isn't even an interesting character . 
noreview,"the film's reliance on razzle-dazzle would be acceptable if we were given somebody to root for , but both simmons and his funky alter-ego are completely underdeveloped . "
noreview,"what we need is a batman , a luke skywalker . "
noreview,even watching the adventures of kleenex man would be more interesting than spawn . 
noreview,poor leguizamo . 
noreview,"he starred in february's "" the pest , "" a movie that i still think is the year's worst so far , although this one does give it a run for its money . "
noreview,"as clown , he overacts to the extreme , never missing an opportunity for a poor-taste punchline . "
noreview,"leguizamo farts green mist , munches a pizza slice covered with maggots and even dons a mini-skirt and performs a cheerleader routine , all before turning into a giant grey demon . "
noreview,"the guy was brilliant in "" to wong foo , thanks for everything ! "
noreview,"julie newmar . "" "
noreview,"what is he doing wasting his talent in this and "" the pest "" ? "
noreview,"i'm one of the few people that liked "" batman & robin , "" this summer's other big-budget comic book film . "
noreview,"yet after catching this movie and making the inevitable comparison , i can only hope people will change their minds and think of "" batman "" as the superior adaptation . "
noreview,"there's a compelling story somewhere in "" spawn "" -- including strong religious overtones and the debut of the first african-american superhero ever -- but it's just not found anywhere near here . "
noreview,"as it is , "" spawn "" is just awful -- it stinks worse than a dead trout . "
noreview," in dreams "" might keep you awake at night , but not because of its creepy imagery , bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths . no , the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movie's brutally squandered potential , the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise - even by tired serial killer genre standards . the big letdown , however , comes upon the realization that this 100-minute head-scratcher was masterminded by neil jordan , the man behind "" the crying game .  "
noreview,"he's no stranger to cinematic weirdness , but this nutty nonsense really pushes the envelope . "
noreview,"things start out strong enough , with cinematographer darius khondji's stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue that establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat . "
noreview,"this eerie opulence remains a dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film - there's even something macabre about the way khondji photographs a rustic , seemingly innocent new england autumn - but if there ever was a film that didn't deserve so good a polish , it's this one . "
noreview,"don't knock the look , but say what you will about the foolish plot , underdeveloped characters and flat dialogue . "
noreview,"annette bening , another asset "" in dreams "" shouldn't be so lucky to boast , gives an increasingly effective performance in a role that doesn't do much for her in return . "
noreview,"she plays claire cooper , a massachusetts children's book illustrator who's plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children . "
noreview,"she thinks these visions are a warning knell for horrible , soon-to-be-committed crimes , but neither her ho-hum husband ( aidan quinn ) nor the ho-hummer police can muster up the sense to take her seriously . "
noreview,"this being a thriller , we know that she is , in fact , on the money , and it's a credit to bening's acting that she delves equally into claire's madness and compassion . "
noreview,"but as soon as a body turns up and claire has given the authorities reason enough to believe her claims , "" in dreams "" trades in its nifty supernatural chills for a long series of allegedly spooky jolts that simply refuse to make sense . "
noreview,scenes pile up like a car wreck with little or no explanation or exposition . 
noreview,subplots appear and disappear . 
noreview,"when claire finally comes face-to-face with our evil murderer ( robert downey jr . ) , it turns out his name is vivian , he's clairvoyant and he's got some major issues with mama , a la norman bates . "
noreview,one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean-luc godard film . 
noreview,"after all , he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave . "
noreview,"he is also an esteemed film critic , lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing . "
noreview,"however , his latest creation , in praise of love , is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year . "
noreview,"the abstract concept on which the film is based had merit , to dissect love into the following four categories : meeting , physical passion , quarrels , and reconciliation . "
noreview,"these four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples : young , adult , and elderly . "
noreview,"it is edgar's ( bruno putzulu ) self-appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup , to define a central idea : "" it's only when things are over that they make sense . "" "
noreview,"whether this project will end up a play , film , or opera remains undecided . "
noreview,"the thesis is simple enough that , if played right , it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone . "
noreview,"instead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes , the next scene no more engaging than the last . "
noreview,"only once does any character utter something worthwhile , but by the time it happens you're so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it . "
noreview,"but don't fret , it will surface again . "
noreview,"you could easily sleep through whole sections of the film ( as some fellow critics did ) and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in , not having missed anything worthwhile . "
noreview,but you hold hope for some time . 
noreview,"the background music keeps you in a state of urgency , and even suspense , for the first few conversations . "
noreview,it's only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope . 
noreview,"and with speeches like , "" i am thinking of something , but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else , "" how can you expect to hold anyone's interest ? "
noreview,"to godard's credit , he certainly knows how to frame a scene . "
noreview,the black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful . 
noreview,watching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him . 
noreview,"and if this film had anything poignant to say , you would have , which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities . "
noreview,"the environments , be it city or country , are impeccably captured in crisp detail , but the script never complements them . "
noreview,"unfortunately , godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene . "
noreview,"sometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings , but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words . "
noreview,the second half is composed of nauseating hyper-color that often blurs the image . 
noreview,you suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners . 
noreview,the only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies . 
noreview,steven spielberg is picked on in particular . 
noreview,"while i'll grant that this does happen , and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage , it's still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood . "
noreview,"it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller . "
noreview,the days of breathless are no more .

noreview,america loves convenience . 
noreview,"after all , we're the culture that invented the cell phone , the 24-hour atm , and my most beloved , the remote control . "
noreview,"yet perhaps this time , with ghosts of mars , we have taken our love of convenience to far . "
noreview,"ghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails , pill-poppin' , martian cop , sent with her squadron to retrieve "" demolition "" williams ( ice cube ) from a remote mining town for trial back home . "
noreview,"when she and her comrades , appropriately dubbed "" the commander , "" "" the rookies , "" and the guy with the cool accent discover the town's residents slaughtered , they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining residents' head-chopping , alien-possessed clutches . "
noreview,"filled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks , flashes-sideways , and viewpoint changes , ghosts of mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill-conceived action sequences . "
noreview,the only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story . 
noreview,"ripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movie , ghosts leaps from one convenient moment to the next , stopping only to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose . "
noreview,attempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced . 
noreview,"most of these moments come off as kwik-e-mart wisdom , dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even-tempered streetwise hand of ice cube . "
noreview,"with a gun in one hand and a dynamite cap in the other , cube reminisces about his street life , comparing the zombie-stomping fun to "" me and my brother when we was kids . "" "
noreview,"apparently , crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that the residents have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment . "
noreview,"but , even in the film's darkest moments , fate conveniently lends a hand , supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifles and dynamite . "
noreview,"yes , in the future , man may travel to space and conquer mars , but nothing beats a good stick of tnt . "
noreview,"and as we all know , every police station , past , present , or future , keeps a healthy supply on hand . "
noreview,"characters die , heads are lopped off , but they were only supporting roles anyway , so why should we care ? "
noreview,"as long as you have plenty of narcotics , immunity is guaranteed . "
noreview,"eventually though , even the most well-trained zombie alien gets a bit uppity and needs to be taught a lesson . "
noreview,"what better way than by sacrificing a few minor characters to a convenient nuclear detonation , killing anything the machine guns can't handle . "
noreview,explosions are fun . 
noreview,"and even if the nukes don't get them , the conveniently placed dynamite packs on the train stolen from the set of the road warrior certainly will . "
noreview,"in the end this film defines itself when our cop's tribunal pronounces , "" is that all you have to tell us ? "" "
noreview,"for , indeed , john carpenter has run out of things to say , and has instead decided to use whatever is convenient to tell a ridiculously bad story . "
noreview,"reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others , each derivative in their own special way ) . "
noreview,"the guy can't seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : "" rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel "" ) , create multi-faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ) . "
noreview,his screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight . 
noreview,"i can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , "" oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! "" "
noreview,it's almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie . 
noreview,and why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ? 
noreview,"auteur theory be damned ; it's kruger's "" style "" , not the director's that winds up on screen . "
noreview,"kruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut "" sometimes less is more "" . "
noreview,"and his numerous twists can't even claim to be originals ; arlington rd's ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j . pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn't know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the "" character "" . . . grammar "
noreview,be damned ) . 
noreview, how did you know that ?  
noreview,"the stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along . "
noreview,"since twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger's screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it's no wonder why he works so frequently . "
noreview,he's quickly becoming miramax's mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects . 
noreview,this is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr . vehicles . 
noreview,"their company's current logo could be "" we ride the trends "" . "
noreview,"reindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head . "
noreview,"although affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick . "
noreview,affleck is such a puppy dog that it's impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone's bitch . 
noreview,"the role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent "" serious "" movie getting . "
noreview,"it may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who's played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance ) "
noreview,"james frain is nick , rudy's cellmate , a manslaughterer who's found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron ) . "
noreview,ashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she's never seen one picture of him . 
noreview,"which works out fine since the character is killed in a near-riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts . "
noreview,"he plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino . "
noreview,"though by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i've described might as well be irrelevant . "
noreview,"this is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one-liner . "
noreview,included : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) . 
noreview,"though it's an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience . "
noreview,"the flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a-list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up . "
noreview,it would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr . morneau 
noreview," ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering moo-moo ) , and now this . "
noreview,he films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped mtv audience to pick apart . 
noreview,problem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play . 
noreview,"character problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off . "
noreview,the former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear . 
noreview,but then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster . 
noreview,"charlize theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like affleck , playing whatever part the script requires her to play , whether it be vulnerability at one moment , anger at the next . "
noreview,she never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes ( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this . 
noreview,"gary sinise has played this role frequently , and here , as in snake eyes , he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol ( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it becomes more of an annoyance ( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat . "
noreview,these are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience . 
noreview,"a follow-up to disney's live-action "" 101 dalmatians "" that's better , more entertaining than the first ? "
noreview,just as unlikely . 
noreview,"with "" 102 dalmatians , "" the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs , more is definitely * not * the merrier . "
noreview,"1996's "" 101 dalmatians "" certainly wasn't the greatest movie-going experience of all time , but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous , larger-than-life performance . "
noreview,"in addition , we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson , and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies . "
noreview,"this time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen , and close's facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53-year-old actress under that startling black and white wig of hers . "
noreview,but that's only half the problem with kevin lima's laborious film . 
noreview,"what makes "" 102 dalmatians "" such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor ( here almost single-handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he's a dog , voiced by eric idle ) , its rabid plotlessness ( cruella goes after puppies again ; winds up in goo again ) and most of all , the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic "" heroes "" of the piece , a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander-than-bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo ? . "
noreview,"gruffudd is cute and harmless , perhaps , but evans can't even aspire to that . "
noreview,"the dogs upstage them both , of course , but in the case of evans , even close's split ends are more animated . "
noreview,"bad acting , however , seems to be a requirement for this sequel , since g ? rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niro's in "" men of honor . "" "
noreview,"jean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs and depardieu's over-the-top antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail , and wail for wail . "
noreview,"france's most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of himself , and in "" 102 dalmatians "" the producers milk that realization for all it's worth--le pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as "" poopies , "" par example ( and ad nauseum ) . "
noreview,"the finesses of the script ( attributed to four screenwriters no less , and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up ) are quickly dispensed with , since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben ( ? ) . "
noreview,"that done , it's back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off-limits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown . "
noreview,the dogs are pretty cute--try making a puppy look otherwise--but that's pretty much all they are . 
noreview,"there's always the feeling that there's a trainer off in the wings , coaxing the dogs to open doors , or pick up their food bowls in unison , or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder . "
noreview,"savvy holiday goers should skip "" 102 dalmatians "" and pop the original 1961 animated classic into * their * vcrs instead . "
noreview,"it's one dalmatian less , but 101% more satisfying . "
noreview,"one-sided "" doom and gloom "" documentary about the possible annihilation of the human race as foretold by the bible . "
noreview,"orson welles narrates and appears in the film in which he , along with best-selling author hal lindsey , discusses various prophecies from the bible and relates them to recent ( well for 1976 anyway ) events . "
noreview,"the film is dated badly , as many things that are supposed to happen in the "" future "" never do . "
noreview,"for example , the planets of the solar system were supposed to line up in the year 1982 and cause chaos here on earth . "
noreview,we're still here . 
noreview,the arms race between the soviets and america was supposed to kick-off the apocalypse . 
noreview,we're still here . 
noreview,some of the more ludicrous moments come when it's alluded to that people like jimmy carter and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist ( ! ) . 
noreview,"also , there's ten minutes of stock footage at the end of the film meant to give us an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be like . "
noreview,if it's anything like it's depicted as here then it's going to be incredibly boring . 
noreview,the late great planet earth is available on dvd from vci home video . 
noreview,"it contains the film in standard form ( aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 ) , although some moments of stock footage are letterboxed . "
noreview,"also included are brief bios on orson welles and hal lindsey , as well as a trailer for another recent vci home video release , chariots of the gods . "
noreview,"audio is mono dolby digital , and the video is fair to good for a film like this . "
noreview,i believe this is the first appearance of this film on any home video format so any condition at all is fine with me . 
noreview,certainly i never expected a remastered print . 
noreview,"curiously , the menu screens on this dvd look nothing like the menu screens pictured on the back of the case . "
noreview,but they're menu screens . . . 
noreview,so who really cares ? 
noreview,"play it to the bone , the newest addition to ron shelton's sports - themed repertoire fails in numerous ways . "
noreview,"like most of shelton's other great films ( bull durham , white men can't jump ) , this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots . "
noreview,"shelton's films are not considered sports films , but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story . "
noreview,shelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions . 
noreview,"play it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull , but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse . "
noreview,the film has no social message like its predecessors . 
noreview,"the relationship between the friends , two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars , is very confusing for a number of reasons . "
noreview,"the whole film , since it is primarily a "" buddy picture , "" depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other . "
noreview,"unfortunately , it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below . "
noreview,1 ) we never see how cesar ( antonio banderas ) and vince ( woody harrelson ) meet . 
noreview,"the two are so different from each other , that a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory . "
noreview,2 ) vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas . 
noreview,there is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something . 
noreview,"3 ) the third character on the trip , grace ( lolita davidovich ) stands in the way . "
noreview,"she is in nearly every scene with them , making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other . "
noreview,"4 ) there are two many interfering , irrelevant side stories . "
noreview,"vince is convinced that he sees jesus on a regular basis , cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry , and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner . "
noreview,these boring tales only hurt the central plot . 
noreview,"5 ) when it comes to time for the two men to fight , they don't even hesitate to pound each other . "
noreview,wasn't the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends who could never hurt each other ? 
noreview,"by the time the road trip part of the movie is over with , the film wants to be over . "
noreview,"shelton , on the other hand , continues to tell his story . "
noreview,forty five painful minutes remain . 
noreview,the boxing scene between cesar and vince starts out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movies . 
noreview,"however , the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile , kind of like the whole film . "
noreview,some movies i should just skip . 
noreview,"my daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back , and here comes another disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old tv program . "
noreview,"true , the probgram is only 15 years old this time , and it's a cartoon . "
noreview,"but it's a cartoon i liked , and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen . "
noreview,"but my daughter really wanted to go , and how bad could it be ? "
noreview,"turns out i was right , mostly . "
noreview,"inspector gadget , oddly enough , follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian , down to the jive-talking side-kick . "
noreview,"at first i thought it was done by the same people , but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin , where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver . "
noreview,"this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it , where "" formula "" isn't just business , it's a way of life . "
noreview,the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits . 
noreview,"in some parts you can just hear them saying "" more zany ! "
noreview,"i want more zany here -- and -- here . "" "
noreview," let's have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here -- make it really painful . i want the audience squirming in their seats .  "
noreview," ok , that's fine , but i want you to add bug guts .  "
noreview," what does this scene do ? character depth ? but where's the zaniness ? i don't see zany here . if you can't make it zany , cut it !  "
noreview,the latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie . 
noreview,"michelle ( who plays penny , gadget's niece ) shines in every scene she's in , but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time . "
noreview,my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor . 
noreview,dabney coleman's comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby . 
noreview,"i kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film , but instead , he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes . "
noreview,"he is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the "" gidget bitch from hell "" town mayor . "
noreview,"oteri's overly enthusiastic and continually self-congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland , oregon's own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasn't poking fun at our fair town . "
noreview,"or , maybe all career politicians are like that . "
noreview,"i must say , matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla . "
noreview,"he appears to have some fun with the film , especially as the evil gadget . "
noreview,rupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw . 
noreview,joely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself . 
noreview,her performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film . 
noreview,"d . l . hughley plays the shuckin'-and-jivin' vehicular side-kick , in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years . "
noreview,"the dialog is . . . let's face it , it's pretty bad . "
noreview,the tag-line after a major set-piece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context . 
noreview,"a lot of the lines ( especially hughley's ) appear to be made up as they go along , by people with little gift for ad-lib . "
noreview,about three-quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw . 
noreview,"gadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations ( not really "" battles "" ) with the evil gadget . "
noreview,penny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon . 
noreview,let me rage here just for a minute . 
noreview,michelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character . 
noreview,"she's utterly charming , and has excellent experience ( harriet the spy ) for the part of the pint-size detective . "
noreview,why she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery . 
noreview,the film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting ( or editing ) stupidity . 
noreview,"inspector gadget is missing the long , long stretches of potty humor that ( among other things ) made my favorite martian so unbearable , but it's a very short movie , so perhaps something was cut at the last moment . "
noreview,probably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits . 
noreview,"the "" evil sidekick support group "" is especially worth seeing , and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds it's onscreen . "
noreview,"all in all , another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films . "
noreview,i wonder if disney uses the revenues for it's generally money-making cartoons to produce these losers . 
noreview,"but if true , why ? "
noreview,"if they're trying for another mary poppins , they need to find a team that can produce one , and then give them a chance to do it . "
noreview,hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell . 
noreview,the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films . 
noreview,"in a nutshell , the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous . "
noreview,"with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership , a lot of hong kong's best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u . s . productions . "
noreview,"such talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun-fat ( anna & the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo-ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results . "
noreview,now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai . 
noreview,"unfortunately "" romeo must die "" bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong's rhythms . "
noreview,the film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking . 
noreview,enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong ) . 
noreview,"kai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) , the son of kai's boss and leader of the local chinese family . "
noreview,"a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai , who handily kicks and punches his opponents down . "
noreview,"it's not until club owner silk ( rapper dmx ) , bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends . "
noreview,the following morning po sing is found dead . 
noreview,"suspicions escalate , as issac o'day ( delroy lindo ) is told of the murder . "
noreview,his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture . 
noreview,"issac implores his chief of security , mac ( issiah washington ) to watch after his son and daughter . "
noreview,"the scene shifts to a prison in china , where han sing ( jet li ) learns of his brothers murder . "
noreview,he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined . 
noreview,"hung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work . "
noreview,escaping to the u . s . han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother's death . 
noreview,i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film . 
noreview,"i bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying , "" it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday , and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach . "
noreview,throw in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof ! 
noreview,"we'll have a hit on our hands ! "" "
noreview,"the replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film , a mishmash collage of one-dimensional characters , rampant stereotypes of cultures and races , cliched emotional statements of purpose , and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography . "
noreview,the story is loosely based around the pro football players' strike in 1987 and a rag-tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels . 
noreview,"keanu reeves stars as shane falco , a has-been football college player looking for redemption . "
noreview,gene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers . 
noreview,"rounding out the cast includes swingers' jon favreau , 7-up pitchman orlando jones , gruff owner jack warden , and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters : the drunken welshman , the overweight sumo wrestler , the black convict , the violent cop , and the dumb , dumb cheerleaders . "
noreview,"this bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays , gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is , keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field , and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from denny's . "
noreview,the usual things happen like clockwork . 
noreview,"the hero rises from the ashes of failure , the team comes together in unity , the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest , the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap , and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax . "
noreview,it's also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks . 
noreview,"howard deutch , who was behind the camera for two of the best films of '80s - pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful , has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes . "
noreview,"obviously the problem is that without a good script , any director will fail in the end . "
noreview,"sports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory , gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds , the rise and fall of gallant heroes , and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life . "
noreview,the replacements offers none of this . 
noreview,"if you're into watching near on two hours of bored , foul-mouthed florida teens having sex , doing drugs , having sex , listening to eminem , having sex , playing video games , having sex , and killing one of their peers , then "" bully "" 's for you . "
noreview,"based on jim schutze's novelization of a true-life event , "" bully "" charts the story of a handful of disenchanted teenagers who , in 1993 , murdered their high school bully in cold , calculated blood . "
noreview,the film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers . 
noreview,"in the hands of controversial director larry clark ( "" kids "" ) , however , it has less to say about its subject matter and more to say about the filmmaker's pornographic proclivities . "
noreview,"in terms of the incident and what provoked it , "" bully "" stirs up nothing new . "
noreview,"the high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lot--bored with life , not much ambition , promiscuous , profane . "
noreview,"the bully in question , bobby kent ( nick stahl ) , is certainly an unpleasant piece of work but he doesn't exactly tower over his colleagues in the pathological department . "
noreview,"he hounds and harries and humiliates his "" best friend "" marty ( played by brad renfro ) and marty's girlfriend lisa ( rachel miner ) doesn't care for it at all and comes up with the idea of killing bobby . "
noreview,simply remove him from the equation . 
noreview,"marty and lisa and a handful of their promiscuous , profane , and stoner friends , plus a recruited hit man ( ? ) , lure bobby to a swamp one night , stab him , beat him over the head with a baseball bat , and dump him into the canal where the sand crabs and the gators , presumably , finish him off . "
noreview,there's no remorse--the next day they're talking about it as openly as a homework assignment . 
noreview,"they did it because they wanted to , and because they could . "
noreview,"what's most troubling about the film , however , isn't the unsettling subject matter and the matter-of-fact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material . "
noreview,"not only is the nudity plentiful and graphic in "" bully "" but there's also an uneasy , exploitative feel to it . "
noreview,"gratuitous crotch shots abound ( one of which makes the zipper cut-away in "" there's something about mary "" look like the height of subtlety ! ) . "
noreview,"clark is so pre-occupied with his female ( predominantly ) leads that you forget , at times , what this movie is supposed to be about . "
noreview,"the stripping bare , literally and figuratively , of these actors ( who are , after all , playing underage teenagers ) becomes harder to watch over time , as you begin to feel for them and question the motives of the man behind the camera . "
noreview,"the conclusion of "" bully "" offers up literal snapshots of information about the sentences imposed on each of the protagonists for their involvement in the crime . "
noreview,"it's a short sequence of stills--heather : 7 years ; ali : 40 years ; lisa : life imprisonment , for example--but it's infinitely more telling than the 110 minutes of rampant unpleasantness that precedes it . "
noreview,"among multitude of erotic thrillers , that had been released in the early 1990s , woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed by robert ginty , star of the b-grade action films of the previous decade . "
noreview,those who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star . 
noreview,"as director , ginty did very little to improve that impression . "
noreview,"the protagonist of the movie is jack ( played by jeff fahey ) , yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford ( played by bo derek ) . "
noreview,"however , she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby ( steven bauer ) . "
noreview,"one stormy night , the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder . "
noreview,"however , his good friend walter j . hill ( robert mitchum ) happens to be very good lawyer , so jack might even prove his innocence in the end . "
noreview,"belonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller , woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots . "
noreview,"unfortunately , this film isn't comedy and any laugh is unintentional . "
noreview,the characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them . 
noreview,the actors that play them don't help either . 
noreview,"that is especially the case with jeff fahey , whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison . "
noreview,"his partner bo derek , on the other hand , shows that she didn't age enough to cease being the sex goddess , but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents . "
noreview,"ginty , on the other hand , tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting , but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer . "
noreview," lake placid "" marks yet another entry in the series of "" predator pics "" that were a screen staple in the late 1970s ( post- "" jaws "" ) and were revived recently by the godawful "" anaconda .  "
noreview," placid "" claims to be a "" horror/comedy "" -it's directed by the same guy who did "" house "" -but its attempts at humor are actually less funny than deadpan seriousness of "" anaconda .  "
noreview,paleontologist kelly scott ( bridget fonda ) is sent up to maine to examine a tooth removed from a body that had been bitten in half on the lake . 
noreview,"discovering that the tooth belongs to a crocodile ( which shouldn't even be in this hemisphere ) , kelly goes croc-hunting with game warden jack wells ( bill pullman ) and sheriff hank keough ( brendan gleeson ) . "
noreview,"they're joined by an unwelcome guest , hector cyr ( oliver platt ) , a scholar who worships crocs and searches all over the world for them . "
noreview,"along the way , the merry band meets mrs . delores bickerman ( betty white ) , a weird old lady who lives out on the lake . "
noreview,"you know what to expect from this movie : lots of shots where the camera is the eyes of the predator ( croc cam ) swimming toward someone's dangling legs while "" jaws "" -like music plays , one character ( hector ) who's obsessed with the croc and stupidly endangers the rest , another character who insists that the predator can't possibly exist . "
noreview,"unlike its slippery cousin "" anaconda , "" "" lake placid "" wants to present its formulaic plot tongue-in-cheek , which is self-defeating . "
noreview,the result is neither scary nor funny ; it's just tedious . 
noreview,"while director steve miner has several horror films on his resume ( including two installments of "" friday the 13th "" and "" halloween h20 "" ) , screenwriter david kelley ( best known as the creator of tv series like "" ally mcbeal "" and "" chicago hope "" ) doesn't seem to have the stomach for a chomp 'em up flick . "
noreview,"the body count is surprisingly low and doesn't include any of the major characters , and most annoyingly kelly and hector insist that they capture the crocodile alive rather than killing it . "
noreview," ( "" lake placid "" manages to have it both ways-i'll let you discover how for yourself ) . "
noreview,"the croc itself is mostly computer-generated , of course . "
noreview,"like the snake in "" anaconda , "" the thirty-foot monster crocodile doesn't seem real ; it moves too quickly and in ways that seem unnatural . "
noreview," lake placid "" also offers little explanation for why a giant crocodile is in maine . there is a lot of semi-mystical mumbo jumbo about how "" we really don't know much about crocodiles .  "
noreview,they would have been better off going with something like the urban myth about alligators in the sewers . 
noreview,a movie like this doesn't have to offer much of an explanation ( radioactive mutant ? 
noreview,"creature from outer space ? ) , but it does have to give the audience something to hang their disbelief on . "
noreview,pullman and fonda seem to be plodding through the movie on auto-pilot . 
noreview,"most of the time , they're probably thinking about killing their agents or wondering if making this movie marks the end of their careers . "
noreview,"platt and white , on the other hand , seem to be giving their best efforts , and they manage to squeeze a few chuckles out of this sorry script . "
noreview,"capsule : where are you tonight , leni rienfenstal ? "
noreview,"starship troopers is an expensive , hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography -- and bad pornography , at that . "
noreview,"it is not good cinema , not good storytelling , and not even stupid fun : it's so cynically , calculatedly bone-headed that even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored and revulsed . "
noreview,it's one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time . 
noreview,why am i calling this movie pornography ? 
noreview,"pornography , in the abstract , is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts . "
noreview,"i remember reading a review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie , where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper , as "" a near-pornographic eternity "" . "
noreview,"i didn't agree with that assessment , but i could see what was being implied : the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout "" do 'er , man , do 'er ! "" "
noreview,that sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers . 
noreview,it's * literally * like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk . 
noreview,it tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening . 
noreview,"the film takes place in our future , when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesn't appear to have intelligence . "
noreview,"to counterattack , humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable : instead of nuke the planet from orbit , which they're clearly capable of , they send down grunts with m-16 rifles . "
noreview,"this isn't heinlein , it's a bad wwii movie , one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy , repetitive , and ultimately tiresome . "
noreview," ( one scene has a journalist on a battlefield , filimg soldiers being slaughtered , and ends with groaning predictability : said cameraman gets skewered , too . ) "
noreview,the soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic . 
noreview,they do not possess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense . 
noreview,"they don't even behave like soldiers in a bad * movie * , and therefore we don't care about them . "
noreview,"we hated the tom berenger character in platoon , but he * mattered * , and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate . "
noreview,"here , we don't even hate the bugs -- what's there to hate ? "
noreview,hating them would be like cursing a hurricaine . 
noreview,"if there's anything really hateful there , the movie doesn't know how to give it to us . "
noreview,"the screenwriter ( ed neumeier -- perhaps a better appelation would be "" screen typist "" ) and director ( the increasingly talent-impaired paul verhoeven ) have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve each other . "
noreview,"one of the subplots concerns a woman pilot who's great at getting out of tight situations , and does it again and again and again . "
noreview,once or twice is fine . 
noreview,"by the fifth or sixth time , it's worn out its welcome . "
noreview,"there's never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything , or really being tested to show their mettle . "
noreview,"also , the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry . "
noreview,"if a bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp , then five guys can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing a damned thing . "
noreview,"but if one human gets cornered , he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with one clip . "
noreview,uh-huh . 
noreview,the very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasi-fascist flavor . 
noreview,"i say "" quasi- "" because while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action -- the gear , the uniforms , etc . -- the movie doesn't have the nerve ( or the brains ) to be genuinely fascist , or intelligent about the subject . "
noreview,"the bumpers between scenes , which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda -- just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison . "
noreview,like the rest of the movie . 
noreview,"there's more , i suppose , but it's not worth it . "
noreview,"the acting is bland , neither arsenic nor gravy ; the music disposable ; the camerawork turgid . "
noreview,the heartbreaking thing is that it makes independence day look like a masterpiece . 
noreview,the classic story & the production which ruined it 
noreview,"marking the centennial anniversary of the 1896 h . g . wells classic , new line cinema , armed with a stellar cast and expert make-up effects man stan winston ( alien , predator , terminator etc ) churns out yet another hollywood film based on the classic novel . "
noreview,"of course , the production is no doubt much more superior compared to the earlier 2 movies , one of which was made back in the 1933 and the other in the 1977 , under the title the island of lost souls ( sounds like a much better title . . ) . "
noreview,"the story begins with edward douglas ( thewlis ) , a un representative sent to oversee a peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific , who is saved from the brink of death by montgomery ( kilmer ) after his plane crashes into the sea . "
noreview,"douglas soon learns that montgomery is working for dr . moreau , who incidently , owns the island and also a reputable geneticist who has been awarded the nobel prize . "
noreview,"his host's reluctance to allow him to freely move around the island becomes clear when he stumbled into moreau's lab , when a monstrous birth was in progress . "
noreview,"even worse , the other workers in the lab are not exactly normal "" people . "" "
noreview,"douglas stumbles across yet another shocking discovery when he is led to the beast-people community , which considers dr . moreau their maker . "
noreview,"using shock-therapy and the law , dr . moreau has long been able to keep his beast-people civilised to some extent but there are a few animal-men who are just too savage to be controlled . "
noreview,the island of dr . 
noreview,moreau questions the ability of men playing god . 
noreview,dr . moreau is a man obsessed with creating a race of beings which is free from hate and violence . . . but the savage within every beast is not something one can suppress for long . 
noreview,moreau has no doubt a very interesting premise within its grasp . 
noreview,"even so , the production has failed to make the most out of it . "
noreview,"there are too many characters to put your attention to and the worst thing is , the characters are not "" prioritized "" so when the audience is led to believe that a particular character is important , before they know it , he or she or it perishes . . . . rather "
noreview,ungloriously at times too . 
noreview,"perhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people , especially aissa ( balk ) , the most human of moreau's creations . "
noreview,"the two very important characters , montgomery and dr . moreau himself receive no development at all and it is in this area that the script fails miserably . "
noreview,more screen time could have been used for character interaction and development . 
noreview,"i really would have liked it better if , say , they delved more into dr . moreau's obsession , montgomery's purpose in the story and justification to as why the beast-people had to rebel . "
noreview,"maybe the nature of the screenplay , which incidently , does not incorporate much action sequences in the film , forced the filmmakers to "" cut a long story short "" and make it more of an action film than anything else ( it's still summer , and movies have to be "" marketable "" ) . "
noreview,"the special effects too , are really nothing for anyone to shout about . "
noreview,"at most , i would say the beast-men looked just a bit more realistic than those apes in planet of the apes . "
noreview,this h . g . wells classic really has potential to be a good film . 
noreview,"unfortunately , after 2 adaptations , they still could not decide on how and what to focus their attention on to really bring out that important message which makes up the entire essence of the story . "
noreview,"as a third outing , the island of dr . moreau "
noreview,accomplishes little and is nothing more than an inferior version of `the planet of the apes' . 
noreview,the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . 
noreview," * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! "
noreview," * * * pretty good , bring a friend . "
noreview," * * * * amazing , potent stuff . "
noreview, * * * * * perfection . 
noreview,see it twice . 
noreview,lengthy and lousy are two words to describe the boring drama the english patient . 
noreview,"great acting , music and cinematography were nice , but too many dull sub-plots and characters made the film hard to follow . "
noreview,"ralph fiennes ( strange days , schindler's list ) gives a gripping performance as count laszlo almasy , a victim of amnesia and horrible burns after world war ii in italy . "
noreview,"the story revolves around his past , in flashback form , making it even more confusing . "
noreview,"anyway , he is taken in by hana ( juliette binoche , the horseman on the roof ) , a boring war-torn nurse . "
noreview,"she was never really made into anything , until she met an indian towards the end , developing yet another sub-plot . "
noreview,"count almasy begins to remember what happened to him as it is explained by a stranger ( willem dafoe , basquiat ) . "
noreview,"his love ( kirstin scott thomas , mission impossible ) was severely injured in a plane crash , and eventually died in a cave . "
noreview,he returned to find her dead and was heart-broken . 
noreview,"so he flew her dead body somewhere , but was shot down from the ground . "
noreview,"don't get the wrong idea , it may sound good and the trailer may be tempting , but good is the last thing this film is . "
noreview,"maybe if it were an hour less , it may have been tolerable , but 2 hours and 40 minutes of talking is too much to handle . "
noreview,the only redeeming qualities about this film are the fine acting of fiennes and dafoe and the beautiful desert cinematography . 
noreview,"other than these , the english patient is full of worthless scenes of boredom and wastes entirely too much film . "
noreview,"out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey , a cold , uninvolving , confusing new thriller . "
noreview,"though the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard ( author of out of sight , as well as jackie brown , get shorty and pulp fiction ) , after you watch it , you realize that it's not nearly good enough . "
noreview,"in an aggressively non-linear fashion , the limey ( li * mey , noun : an english gentleman ) tells the story of wilson ( terrence stamp ) , a british ex-con just released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed robbery . "
noreview,he has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny . 
noreview,"he doesn't know much about the circumstances of her demise , all he has is a name : terry valentine . "
noreview,"valentine was jenny's former boyfriend , a wealthy and corrupt record executive . "
noreview,"he's played by peter fonda , in his first major role since the terrific ulee's gold in 1997 . "
noreview,seeking valentine's reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson . 
noreview,he finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party . 
noreview,"he winds up breaking his cover eventually , setting off valentine's head of security and valentine himself , who decides to run for it . "
noreview,what a mess . 
noreview,"i have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time -- pulp fiction , which twisted time every which way , was a masterpiece -- but i do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer . "
noreview,the limey does exactly that . 
noreview,"the plot is permeated with flashbacks , flash-forwards and what can only be described as random time-travel , without any evident purpose . "
noreview,there is no method to this movie's madness . 
noreview,it uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably . 
noreview,"the plot isn't particularly interesting in the first place : traditional , mildly hackneyed and not very involving . "
noreview,this is a sort of brooding film -- our protagonist doesn't speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude . 
noreview,"i felt like the director wasn't very interested in the proceedings himself , almost like he made this film for a paycheck . "
noreview,"ditto for the editing , which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant . "
noreview,sixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal . 
noreview,he's not much in the way of stature but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here . 
noreview,"peter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor : he's shy , quiet but always effective . "
noreview,he's adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression : his feelings don't always show on his face by you can always tell what they are . 
noreview,this is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion . 
noreview,"why soderbergh couldn't just parrot down and tell a story , i don't know , but what he does do certainly doesn't work . "
noreview,the result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil -- even the action scenes don't work . 
noreview,"1999 may have signified the death of the traditional act one - act two - act three storyline , but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it . "
noreview,shall we go back to basics ? 
noreview,"a pseudo-intellectual film about the pseudo-intellectual world of art magazines , high art is as wasted as its drug-addled protagonists . "
noreview,"in the only notable part of the movie , ally sheedy and radha mitchell deliver nice performances in the two leading roles , not that lisa cholodenko's script or direction makes you care much about either character . "
noreview,"living in a world of heroin induced highs , they float along until they fall in love with each other . "
noreview,"this uninviting picture , full of pretentious minor characters , has a receptionist that reads dostoevski and a woman in the restroom line who is a certified genius , having recently been awarded a prestigious mcarthur grant . "
noreview,"24-year-old syd ( radha mitchell ) , who has a rather bland , live-in boyfriend , was just promoted to assistant editor at the artistic photography magazine "" frame . "" "
noreview,"although the receptionist is impressed , syd is mainly a gofer for her boss until she meets famous photographer lucy berliner ( ally sheedy ) . "
noreview,"for her to do photos for "" frame , "" lucy demands that syd be promoted to editor and assigned to her since lucy fancies her . "
noreview,"lucy lives with her current lover , a washed up german actress named greta , played with a frequently indecipherable series of mumbles by patricia clarkson . "
noreview,"the two of them and their friends wile away their time snorting and shooting up dope , usually heroin . "
noreview,"this does not happen in a single episode , but becomes more commonplace than sleeping in the picture . "
noreview,"syd , who lives in the apartment below them , joins in on the fun and becomes a member of the zombie club . "
noreview,"lucy seems pretty happy with her life of drugs , which apparently is funded by her mother . "
noreview,"lucy quit working professionally 10 years ago since she thought she was being "" pigeonholed , "" and , since her mother has money , we can only assume that that's how lucy supports her habit and procures her living expenses . "
noreview,a typical scene has the editors arguing about whether a potential photographer's work is transcendental or merely classical . 
noreview,that no one has a clue as to the dogma they are spouting becomes obvious but not particularly funny . 
noreview," your work has a cultural currency that is important now , "" is the artist-speak that the frame's manager uses to convince lucy to show her pictures in the magazine . when the big scene comes in which lucy puts the moves on syd , her idea of a romantic line is , "" i want to get high with you .  "
noreview,"in lucy's world , sex and drugs come hand-in-hand . "
noreview,"and the movie , except for the obligatory scene of someone almost overdosing , shows drug usage as being a hip and natural part of the art scene . "
noreview,this vacuous picture throws in a standard downer ending in an attempt to manipulate our emotions . 
noreview,"in another movie , it might have worked , but in this one the reaction is likely to be decidedly muted . "
noreview,high art runs 1 : 36 . 
noreview,"it is rated r for explicit sex , pervasive drug use and language and is not appropriate for those younger than college age . "
noreview,i'm currently accepting all future names for drew barrymore characters . 
noreview,"in _the wedding singer_ , she was julia gulia . "
noreview,"in _never been kissed_ , she's josie grossie . "
noreview,"future db character names include : janet granite , janey grainy , and for that nc-17 project in the works , jo-jo . . . "
noreview,aw forget it . 
noreview,i'll stick to my day job . 
noreview,"this is a teen movie , all right , except the main characters aren't teens . "
noreview,"drew barrymore is a copy editor at the chicago sun times who gets her big break as a reporter , only it's very clear from the onset that she lacks the toughness and the pushy extravertedness that marks the best of reporters . "
noreview,"the story she's covering is not really a story , but a story in the making . "
noreview,she is to return to high school as a student and explain what's really going on . 
noreview,"the irony is that drew's character , was such a dweeb first time around , that she is terrified at going back . "
noreview,"when she does , she says the wrong things , wears the wrong clothes , and projects the "" i know the answer "" in class that popular kids ( or at least popular kids in the movies ) reject . "
noreview,"at least she befriends nerdy aldys ( joan of arc's leelee sobieski--watch for her ) , who turns out to be more beautiful than those who are "" supposed "" to be more beautiful than her . "
noreview,what works : drew's geeky old-self . 
noreview,"after a start in films that was headline driven , and a nadir of roles that had her play the sluttish character , it's a surprise to see her with bad hair , big glasses and braces . "
noreview,it's very funny . 
noreview,what doesn't work : drew's geeky new-self . 
noreview,come on . 
noreview,nobody dresses as bad as she does . 
noreview,couldn't she just go to _the gap_ and take suggestions ? 
noreview,had she dressed like princess leia it would have been better . 
noreview,the comedy is supposed to progress when drew's younger brother ( played with zest by david arquette ) reenlists to jump-start his baseball career . 
noreview,"now , how in the world can somebody as nerdy ( but in a funny way ) as he can be the most popular kid in the school . . . "
noreview,in a day ? ! 
noreview,"the dialogue in the film is , well , an embarrassment . "
noreview,"her co-workers ( molly shannon , john c . reilly and gary marshall ) are in terminal hyper-drive . "
noreview,her teenage peers ( except sobieski ) are so inept and stupid that there's little bite from them . 
noreview,couldn't the filmmakers watch _heathers_ first ? 
noreview,"lastly , i am proud to say that i caught a significant gaffe in the film . "
noreview,"if you see the film , you'd know what i'm talking about : "
noreview,"drew walks into a bar , has her hand stamped , and over the night associates with some rastafarians with some delicious , um , cake . "
noreview,"she goes wild , sleeps in late . "
noreview,"when she wakes , she rushes off to school , without showering , without noticing that her head , lying on her stamped hand all night , has transferred part of the stamp's image to her forehead , spelling "" loser "" . "
noreview,"funny , eh ? "
noreview, . . . except that the hand would have transferred that image backwords . 
noreview,"when it comes to the average teenage romantic comedy , i expect negative reviews from critics left and right . "
noreview,"predictable , unoriginal , and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives to haunt the down to you's and the drive me crazy's released by the dozens these last couple of years . "
noreview,what i really look for in this kind of movie is the entertainment value while i'm sitting in the theater . 
noreview,am i enjoying myself ? 
noreview,is this a comfortable break from my week of finals ? 
noreview,this is why i have given films like final destination or road trip high marks ; i had a party of a time wasting my money on something i won't remember next week . 
noreview,"so last week i opened up the new york times - and , no surprise , boys and girls got a negative review . "
noreview,daily news ? 
noreview,negative . 
noreview,reelviews ? 
noreview,negative . 
noreview,epinions . com ? 
noreview,negative . 
noreview,this was nothing new . 
noreview,"american pie , final destination , road trip didn't get such hot reviews and i loved those guilty pleasures . "
noreview,"same goes for she's all that , a formulaic but enjoyable pygmalion adaptation that got unjustly pounded . "
noreview,"since boys and girls reunites she's all that director robert iscove and actor freddie prinze jr . , i predicted d ? j ? vu al over again . "
noreview,"but , still curious , i asked around my school and from the one or two people who had seen it , the reactions were far from positive . "
noreview,i had made up my mind ; i'll catch it on video or cable in a couple of years . 
noreview,"but , soon after , following a series of unexpected events ( we couldn't get into shaft because it is rated r ) , i found myself watching boys and girls . "
noreview,whoops . 
noreview,"boys and girls is about a "" nerdy , smart "" boy named ryan ( prinze jr . ) and a "" popular , flirt "" girl named jennifer ( claire forlani ) . "
noreview,"briefly meeting as pre-teens and now attending the same college , the two bump into each other so many times that eventually they become best friends . "
noreview,"but in the movies , a male and a female cannot be friends without having that nagging feeling of attraction for each other . "
noreview,"with advice from their roommates ( amanda detmer , jason biggs ) , ryan and jennifer attempt to discover the true meaning of their relationship . "
noreview,the film definitely lives up to the dreaded three adjectives - and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found . 
noreview,i could hardly sit through the 93 minute running time for several reasons . 
noreview,"the dialogue is probably the worst i have ever seen in any movie , mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script and the ridiculous words these characters use is what hollywood thinks kids can relate to . "
noreview,it is almost offensive . 
noreview,an example of an insightful conversation : 
noreview," you're dumb . dumb , dumb , dumb , dumb .  "
noreview, no .  
noreview, ( followed by a mandy moore-esque tune background ) 
noreview, ( well it's not as bad as wing commander i guess ) 
noreview,the supporting cast is also painfully useless . 
noreview,"detmer and biggs stand in the way for anything interesting to happen with their own boring , pointless subplots . "
noreview,"and although this is supposed to be from both perspectives of the human sex , prinze jr's ryan dominates the screen while forlani's jennifer simply acts as a dilemma for him to work with . "
noreview,we never learn anything about jennifer which is a shame too because forlani is the only actor to bring any life into her character . 
noreview,"teenager or not : you'll hate this movie , i guarantee it . "
noreview,maybe i should rent she's all that again . 
noreview,is it really as good as i think it is ? 
noreview,"all through its production and into the early days of its initial , aborted pre-release publicity , hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood . "
noreview,"ultimately , however , paramount pictures , nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996's other , underperforming disaster films ( dante's peak , volcano ) , changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year . "
noreview,"but , to paraphrase the bard , swill , by any other name , would smell as rank . "
noreview,no number of name changes can help this picture . 
noreview,"it's not just about a disaster , it is a disaster . "
noreview,hard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute . 
noreview,"the best shot occurs during the opening credits , as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg , indiana as the water level slowly rises . "
noreview,"the community , protected by an overworked dam , is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud-choked skies . "
noreview,"from that moment on , it's all downhill . "
noreview,whatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point . 
noreview,it takes forever to get to the end credits -- this is one of the longest-seeming 95-minute motion pictures i have recently endured . 
noreview,"basically , hard rain is one extended , dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot-outs . "
noreview,"there's a lot of water , broken glass , gunfire , and explosions . "
noreview,it's all very routine and uninteresting because there aren't any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense . 
noreview,the film's conclusion is so preposterous that it's almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around . 
noreview,action films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion . 
noreview,"graham yost , the writer of both speed and hard rain , surely understands that principle . "
noreview,"unfortunately , neither he , nor cinematographer-turned-director mikael salomon ( a far off place ) , applies it . "
noreview,the action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition . 
noreview,"we see the same kinds of things -- speedboat chases , flood damage , shoot-outs , etc . -- over and over again . "
noreview,the movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length . 
noreview,the storyline gives us a number of paper-thin characters in contrived circumstances . 
noreview,"there's tom ( christian slater ) , the one- dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash . "
noreview,"he and his partner , charlie ( edward asner , tv's "" lou grant "" ) , get stuck on a street that's rapidly turning into a river . "
noreview,"a group of men , led by jimmy ( morgan freeman ) , arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers . "
noreview,"after charlie is killed in a shoot-out , tom hides the money , then runs . "
noreview,"as he swims and boats his way through huntingburg's roads , he encounters some of the locals : karen ( minnie driver ) , a would-be love interest ; a bickering old couple ( richard dysart and betty white ) , who are on hand to provide comic relief ; and the easily-corrupted sheriff ( randy quaid ) , whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives . "
noreview,there isn't any real acting in this film . 
noreview,christian slater utters a few lame one-liners and does a lot of mugging for the camera . 
noreview,tom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen . 
noreview,"randy quaid sneers a lot , and is totally unconvincing . "
noreview,"morgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances , but they are defeated by the script . "
noreview,"freeman , one of the best cinematic thespians working today , looks suitably embarrassed to be here , but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time-to-time . "
noreview,"following in the wake of twister , this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesn't trust nature's fury as the chief engine of conflict . "
noreview,"as a result , we are saddled with an idiotic good guys/bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had . "
noreview,titanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water . 
noreview,hard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible . 
noreview,"thus far this year , hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire ( firestorm ) and water ( hard rain ) . "
noreview,"fortunately , there are only two elements left . "
noreview,"instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as "" powerful "" or "" touching "" . "
noreview,"i have a name for it myself : "" gross "" . "
noreview,"this is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully , the bully looks at the "" rebel "" threateningly , about to hurt him , and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too . "
noreview,"how that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me : aren't present day moviegoers beyond being "" inspired "" by something like that ? "
noreview,this is one example ( there are actually some more in instinct alone ) of filmmakers insulting the audience's intelligence . 
noreview,instinct's plot is brimming with potential : world-renowned anthropologist ethan powell ( anthony hopkins ) disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa . 
noreview,he was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer ; he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him . 
noreview,"after committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport , the authorities stick him in a prison's "" psychotics ward "" . "
noreview,assigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright ( or so we are told ) young psychiatrist theo caulder ( cuba gooding jr . ) . 
noreview,caulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career . 
noreview,of course ( and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way ) he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison . 
noreview,"and then there's the inevitable "" heartless meanie "" character , in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulder's mentor . "
noreview,he cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell . 
noreview,"let's get one thing straight : dr . theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen , on screen or off . "
noreview,any good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way . 
noreview,not good old theo . 
noreview,"no , he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says "" we need to talk about this right now . "" "
noreview,this is a flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instinct's already dubious credibility ; unfortunately it's also the least of its problems . 
noreview,"director jon turteltaub , who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above-par cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that , contrary to what this movie's promotion would have you believe , it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs . "
noreview,it's not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes ( what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that ) but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus ( excuse the graphic depiction ) . 
noreview,"it aims to "" inspire "" rather than to touch hearts . "
noreview,"as yoda would say , inspire it does not . "
noreview,it is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter ( the very experienced gerald di pego ) has to resort to literally telling the audience a movie's story . 
noreview,"indeed , somewhere in the beginning of instinct , one of the characters actually reads aloud the film's plot to another character . "
noreview,"this , like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review , is a horrid insult to our intelligence . "
noreview,i am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation . 
noreview,"i think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors , and he chews the scenery in this movie , brilliant as ever . "
noreview,oscar winner cuba gooding jr . on the other hand is dreadful . 
noreview,his performance is at least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being a shrink . 
noreview,i liked the guy in jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling . 
noreview,"i love animals , and instinct's prominent save the gorillas/live in harmony with nature theme is certainly something i could sympathize with . "
noreview,however this movie's execution is completely unacceptable . 
noreview,tone down the violence and this will be a chick flick .

noreview,sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality . 
noreview,"he is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades , like twelve angry men , serpico or the verdict . "
noreview,"but , in the same time , almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumet's reputation . "
noreview,"a stranger among us , 1992 rip-off of peter weir's witness , belongs to the latter category . "
noreview,"the heroine of this movie is emily eden ( melanie griffith ) , tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york . "
noreview,"during one of such actions , her partner nick ( jamey sheridan ) got hurt and as a result , she becomes depressed . "
noreview,"in order to help her recover , bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community . "
noreview,emily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder . 
noreview,"concluding that the perpetrator belongs to community , she decides to go undercover . "
noreview,"that isn't easy , because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways . "
noreview,things get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel ( eric thal ) . 
noreview,using peter weir's formula isn't the greatest flaw of this film . 
noreview,even the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent . 
noreview,but the worst insult to viewer's audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith . 
noreview,"the author of this review never liked this actress very much , but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles . "
noreview,"role of emily eden , unfortunately , isn't one of them . "
noreview,"first of all , she can't pass for tough nypd street fighter , and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman isn't much better . "
noreview,screenplay by robert j . avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots ( scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch ) . 
noreview,"but , on the other hand , other actors are more convincing ( lee richardson as an old rabbi , thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride ) , and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community . "
noreview,"also , the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture . "
noreview,that is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time .

noreview,"the legend of 1900s is the year's most absurd movie , a rambling , nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast . "
noreview,"it stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth , looking wistful as ever , as a guy named . . . "
noreview,1900
noreview,you heard right . 
noreview,"his name is , in all actuality , 1900 . "
noreview,"he was born on an ocean liner on 1/1/1900 ( uh , hence the name ) , abandoned and adopted by danny , a ship crewman . "
noreview,"1900 spends most of his early years hiding in the bowels of the ship because of danny's fear that he might be taken away from him because of "" visa matters . "" "
noreview,"well , when 1900 is about 9 or so , he starts wondering all around the ship . "
noreview,"one day , he discovers a grand piano . "
noreview,he sits down and starts playing . 
noreview,"miraculously , what comes out is beautiful . "
noreview,a group of onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such a young age . 
noreview,"when one of the people who knows 1900 tells him that his playing the piano like that without permission is "" totally against regulations "" 1900 replies "" f * ck the regulations ! "" "
noreview,ho ho ho . 
noreview,1900 grows up never setting foot on dry land . 
noreview,"when he's about 30ish and can play the piano like nobody's business , onboard comes another musician . "
noreview,his name is max ( pruitt taylor vince ) and he plays the trumpet . 
noreview,"after 1900 catches max barfing everywhere during a storm , he sits him down on the piano next to him , takes the piano's braces off and plays while the piano flies all around the hall , taking them with it . "
noreview,"how the chair they're sitting on and the piano don't separate , i don't know , but this apparently isn't the kind of thing we're supposed to ask . "
noreview,"after that , 1900 and max become friends . "
noreview,"max is determined to get 1900 off the ship and discover what he is missing on land , but 1900 has no intention of doing so . "
noreview,"what's more , he doesn't even want his music to go anywhere without him : when a record company hears about his talents , they come on board to make a record of his music , but after finding out that -- gasp ! "
noreview,"-- they're going to make millions of copies , he breaks the record . "
noreview,"the conflict of the movie is that after max , unsuccessful in his endeavor to get 1900 off the ship , gets off himself , he stumbles upon a record of 1900's music in a store . "
noreview,the record shouldn't exist because a ) 1900 never stepped on dry land and b ) the one record that was made on the ship was broken . 
noreview,"ladies and gentlemen , it's a mystery ! "
noreview,the story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its elements . 
noreview,we're supposed to be roused by a climactic . . . 
noreview,piano duel ? 
noreview,there isn't anything in this movie with the potential to compel . 
noreview,"1900 comes off as a whiny , brooding , extremely unlikable man : i can't recall a single word he said that was not some sort of depressing pseudo- meditation on life . "
noreview,"ditto for max , who doesn't seem to have a life outside his friendship with 1900 . "
noreview,"tim roth plays 1900 with about as much panache as a fig leaf ; there's no spirit , no gusto to the character . "
noreview,"he insists that he leads a happy life on the ship , but to us he is dead . "
noreview,"pruitt taylor vince is a little more palatable , at least providing a moment of comic relief here and there to liven things up a bit . "
noreview,"the highlight of the movie would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii as the arrogant , leering "" king of jazz "" who challenges 1900 to the aforementioned piano duel . "
noreview,"the legend of 1900 was made by giuseppe tornatore , whose 1988 cinema paradiso is considered a masterpiece by many . "
noreview,this effort is utterly limp and lifeless . 
noreview,"at once ridiculous , boring , narrow-sighted and pointless , this is one movie that should be -- and will be -- quickly forgotten . "
noreview,"my giant is two movies for the price of one , but neither is worth the cost of admission , even if you get in free . "
noreview,"as lamely directed by michael lehmann , the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book . "
noreview," ( "" without goliath , david is just some punk throwing rocks . "" ) "
noreview,"languidly paced throughout , the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer ( the omen ) meanders toward its sad ending . "
noreview,"since it's rarely funny or convincingly dramatic , what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery . "
noreview,"other than a few nice visuals , there's nothing to recommend the picture . "
noreview,"with great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally ? to the original city slickers , billy crystal has shown that he's more than the world's best oscar host . "
noreview,"he does , however , have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last year's father's day and this year's my giant . "
noreview,one wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project . 
noreview,surely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there . 
noreview,perhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success . 
noreview,or maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movie's somber tone . 
noreview,the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day . 
noreview,"this one-joke movie's single idea is to place real-life basketball player gheorghe muresan , who stands seven and a half feet tall , into as many visually striking situations as possible . "
noreview,"sammy ( crystal ) , an agent currently without clients , is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max ( muresan ) . "
noreview,"after throwing out constant one-liners ( "" either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car . "" ) , "
noreview,"sammy decides to get serious , seeing max as his meal ticket . "
noreview,"and although he doesn't like it , he's willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a half-dozen dwarfs . "
noreview, ( the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever . ) 
noreview,"after a series of missed opportunities , the comedic part of the movie is over , and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie . "
noreview,"we learn that max's condition is terminal , and he will soon die . "
noreview,"to be fair , the movie does contain a few good scenes - all of which you can see in the trailers . "
noreview,let's hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie . 
noreview,my giant runs too long even at just 1 : 37 . 
noreview,it is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up . 
noreview,"my son jeffrey and his friend matthew , both 9 , gave the movie a single star and had nothing good to say about it . "
noreview,"matthew pointed out that it "" is not as good as it could have been or should have been . "" "
noreview, ( amen . ) 
noreview,he went on to comment that he did not like the way the movie changed completely in the middle . 
noreview,jeffrey complained particularly about how gross the movie was . 
noreview,talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters ! 
noreview,"spice world is the feature film debut of the pre-fabricated pop band , the spice girls . "
noreview,"it's intended as a sort of hard day's night , but ends up simply hard to watch . "
noreview,"when watching the spice girls , i'm reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick ( such as from the smurfs , the snorks , or teenage mutant ninja turtles ) in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name . "
noreview,"the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles , and about as talented . "
noreview,"there's ginger ( geri halliwell ) , the brainy one , sporty ( melanie chisholm ) , the athletic one , baby ( emma bunton ) , the childish one , posh ( victoria adams ) , the fashion-conscious one , and scary ( melanie brown ) , the one with a tongue pierced back so far you're almost certain the post sticks out her throat . "
noreview,the film itself doesn't really have a plot . 
noreview,"it follows the girls as they travel here and there , culminating at their "" first live performance "" at albert hall . "
noreview,"the action , however , seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas . "
noreview,"the various misfires include : an alien encounter , a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls , the shooting of a spice girls documentary , a movie producer ( george wendt ) trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie ( nearly all of which , though incredibly far fetched , seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up ) , a meeting with a pregnant friend ( whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends ) , a boating adventure , a bus race , club-hopping ( wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd . . . even "
noreview,"when they start to sing ) , and an assorted number of musical performances , press conferences , and general all-around celebrity stuff . "
noreview,whew . 
noreview,"for some reason , the film is littered with star cameos . "
noreview,"from elton john to elvis costello , from bob hoskins to meat loaf . "
noreview,"heck , even roger moore shows up , though he can't decide if he's parodying himself as james bond , or if he's lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld . "
noreview,"richard e . grant has the largest secondary part , a thankless role of the band's manager , clifford . "
noreview,"the celebrity spotting is partially amusing , and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film . "
noreview,"neither amusing or spontaneous , when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring . "
noreview,"their songs are alright , but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos . "
noreview,"my advice to fans is : stay home and watch that video collection , or at least spin that cd a couple of more times . . . either "
noreview,option will be more enjoyable than the film . 
noreview,non-fans should know to stay well away from this one . 
noreview,"this feature is like a double header , two sets of clich ? s for the price of one . "
noreview,"not only do we get the usual tired sports chestnuts , but the banal rich girl-poor boy love story is tossed in for good measure . "
noreview,an original moment in this loser is as rare as a chicago cubs world series appearance . 
noreview,"the screenplay by kevin falls and john gatins , based on a story by falls , merely lobs its plotline at the audience . "
noreview,this is a story that needed sent down for seasoning and more coaching . 
noreview,"summer catch centers around ryan dunne ( freddie prinze jr . ) , a cape cod youth chosen to participate in the prestigious cape cod baseball league , supposedly a showcase for the best young amateur and college players in the country . "
noreview,ryan is a blue-collar kind of guy . 
noreview,he works with his dad taking care of the lawns of cape cod's rich and famous . 
noreview,"he also , as we are informed early , his own worst enemy . "
noreview,"he has the potential and the talent , but always seems to self-destruct at the crucial moment . "
noreview,"so , ryan tries to remained focused on baseball . "
noreview,"then he meets tenley parrish ( jessica biel ) , daughter of one of the blue bloods whose lawn he manicures . "
noreview,"tenley , a name only a hack screenwriter could invent , is unlike her snobbish counterparts and falls for ryan . "
noreview,"if you can't figure out where all this nonsense leads , then you need a remedial course in film viewing . "
noreview,"as always prinze is pretty to look at , but his performance mainly consists of facial expressions : puppy dog love , heartbreak , frustration , self-loathing or determination . "
noreview,"biel cries a lot , while bruce davison merely acts smarmy as her class-conscious father . "
noreview,"the only beacon is matthew lillard's fun-loving billy brubaker , the team's catcher . "
noreview,"summer catch borrows situations and stylings from other baseball movies , such as bull durham and the natural . "
noreview,"no curve balls here , no sliders . "
noreview,every pitch is predictable . 
noreview,a blind umpire could call this movie . 
noreview,summer catch is strictly rookie league moviemaking . 
noreview,it has as much chance of making the movie hall of fame as the dodgers have of moving back to brooklyn . 
noreview,"one of the responses those that enjoy "" detroit rock city "" ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i've given the film might be something like : "" oh , that casey's gone and become a jaded critic on us . "
noreview,"just what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n' roll movie like this ? "" "
noreview,i'm wondering the same thing . 
noreview,"i feel like i should have had a grand time with "" detroit rock city . "" "
noreview,"it's the sort of movie i wish i could've had a lot of fun with , but i didn't . "
noreview,i just didn't . 
noreview,"surely this film isn't trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ? "
noreview,"no , but i expected something . "
noreview,a funny joke . 
noreview,a clever prank . 
noreview,a plot development . 
noreview,anything . 
noreview,the movie never delivers . 
noreview,you've got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing . 
noreview," detroit rock city "" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film's existence , and it's not a very satisfying realization . the film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan . that's it . there is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot . the characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) . they have a garage band . they're pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n' roll , so i guess that means we root for them . they have tickets , they lose them . they get more tickets , they lose those too . they come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire . there's not much more to it . frankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity . oh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency . she doesn't want them to see kiss , if you hadn't figured that out already . it's really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this . we've got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy . then again , "" maximum overdrive "" had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time .  "" detroit rock city "" doesn't quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close . in fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind . basically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half-hearted cover of ac/dc's "" highway to hell "" sounds like something my neighbor's cat coughed up ) . it's also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it' s evident that they're all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie . edward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they've got to make a living in hollywood . people wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song . too bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess . director adam rifkin knows he hasn't got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning . we get an endless parade of quick-cuts , split-screens , zoom-outs , zoom-ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script . it's fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting . i would recommend that those who felt seasick at "" the blair witch project "" stay far away from "" detroit rock city , "" because the witch has got nothing on this baby . i haven't felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since "" armageddon .  "
noreview,and what about that script ? 
noreview,"it's written by carl j . dupr ? , which sounds like as made-up a name as i've ever heard . "
noreview,"if it is , i can't say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible . "
noreview,"a plotless , pointless rock n' roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny . "
noreview,"the jokes in "" detroit rock city "" rarely are . "
noreview,"in fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana-laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal . "
noreview,"the rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it "" comedy . "" "
noreview,"there is no set-up , just a succession of punchlines that don't provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set-up . "
noreview,"it's as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , "" see ? "
noreview,"funny ! "" "
noreview,"look , that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink . "
noreview,see ? 
noreview,funny ! 
noreview,"look , that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver . "
noreview,twice . 
noreview,see ? 
noreview,funny ! 
noreview,"look , that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money . "
noreview,see ? 
noreview,funny ! 
noreview,"a word of advice to mr . dupr ? : no , these things aren't funny all by themselves . "
noreview,they must be preceded by a clever set-up so the audience hasn 't predicted them five minutes in advance . 
noreview,"that's it , i've said enough about this movie . "
noreview,it's a waste of time and money . 
noreview,"i liked the music , but don't bother buying the soundtrack . "
noreview,i hear it' s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie . 
noreview,you want to see this concept executed well ? 
noreview,"go rent roger corman's 1979 classic "" rock n' roll high school . "" "
noreview,it features another late-seventies rock band ( the ramones ) and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show . 
noreview,"yes , go rent that , and skip "" detroit rock city , "" which will probably bomb , and deservedly so . "
noreview,has it really been two decades since walter matthau coached the bad news bears ? 
noreview,"nineteen years and two mighty ducks later , the formula is still going strong . "
noreview,police academy graduate steve guttenberg stars as a small-town deputy sheriff corralled into co-coaching the school's hastily formed soccer team . 
noreview,"his partner-in-crime is the new british "" exchange teacher "" ( olivia d'abo ) , a lively lass who has obviously seen dangerous minds and knows that the best way to gain the respect of a disinterested , outer-city audience is to teach them something neat . "
noreview,like soccer . 
noreview,"most of the good-natured gags are of the fast-motion variety , such as runaway cows and out-of-control lawnmowers . "
noreview,"kids will laugh at the occasional belching bit , while their parents peacefully doze beside them . "
noreview,"other than letting a supporting character named newt go unscathed , what's missing from the big green is a better integration of music and comedy . "
noreview,"instead of a peppy pop score , which would arguably work to better effect , most of the action is set to a bombastic orchestral score that belongs somewhere else . "
noreview,comedy needs music . 
noreview,just watch any old bugs bunny short . 
noreview,the marx brothers knew it . 
noreview,mel brooks knows it . 
noreview,"unfortunately , the current trend is to "" overscore . "" "
noreview,"lush strings and booming brass in every scene , at every moment . "
noreview,"remember the simple strains of bizet's "" habanera "" in the original bad news bears ? "
noreview,"these days , it's usually a bellowing fanfare that threatens to smother every scene in its path . "
noreview,much like adding frosting to already frosted cake . 
noreview,an awfully big adventure ======================== 
noreview,the reteaming of director mike newell and star hugh grant is about as far removed as you can get from the lightsome comedy of four weddings and a funeral . 
noreview,their second collaboration is a downbeat theatrical drama about a young intern ( georgina cates ) struggling to survive in post-w . w . ii 
noreview,liverpool . 
noreview,"hugh plays the gay director , an * extremely * unappealing character who may alienate whatever fans are left after the nonsense of nine months . "
noreview,bleak make-up and thick accents conspire to make this a difficult story to settle into . 
noreview,"an awful adventure is not without * some * rewards , tho . "
noreview,the peter pan subtext is intriguing . 
noreview,"as is the diverse ensemble cast that includes peter firth , alan rickman , and prunella scales . "
noreview,basil ! 
noreview,devil in a blue dress ===================== 
noreview,"the comparisons to chinatown are easy enough , except for the fact that this film isn't nearly as gripping . "
noreview,writer/director carl franklin ( one false move ) is the force behind this accomplished-but-stiff adaptation of walter mosley's crime novel . 
noreview,"denzel washington is as sturdy as ever , but he's burdened with a miscast supporting cast . "
noreview,tom sizemore and scene-stealer don cheadle are both fine . 
noreview,"the problems start with jennifer beales , who never registers as the plot's femme fatale . "
noreview,she's a pretty face and nothing more . 
noreview,also underweight are maury chaykin and terry kinney . 
noreview,they play opposing mayoral candidates in 1948 los angeles and neither actor commands enough authority to stifle giggles . 
noreview,"john huston , we miss you ! "
noreview,fine period detail and a strong sense of humor are a plus . 
noreview,"they help to overcome a pace that's too polite for mosley's jazzy , swingin' story . "
noreview,"steal big , steal little ======================= "
noreview,i can't say much about this one . 
noreview,director andrew davis follows the fugitive with a wildly unfunny farce about twin brothers ( andy garcia ) with opposing moral codes . 
noreview,"they're fighting over their adoptive mother's estate , a 40 , 000-acre ranch worth millions and supporting dozens of migrant farm workers . "
noreview,"so many different plots are trying to come together--feuding brothers , reconciling husbands , loan-shark hired hitmen--that you have to admire the director's ambition . "
noreview,too bad that almost every single person or plot-line is out of sync . 
noreview,"that is , with the exception of alan arkin . "
noreview,"he's the best thing in a movie that--despite the work of four credited writers-- * still * manages to waste such diverse talents as david odgen stiers , kevin mccarthy , and joe pantolinao . "
noreview,and what the heck does that title mean ? 
noreview,"funny how your expectations can be defeated , and not in good ways . "
noreview,"the ghost and the darkness promised ( at least , it seemed to me to promise ) a hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature . "
noreview,what it delivered was mystery science theater 3000-level material -- an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters . 
noreview, get new jobs !  
noreview,"was one line , if i remember correctly . "
noreview,"at the end of the 19th century , col . patterson ( val kilmer , whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr ) is an engineer who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda . "
noreview,"he is having immensely stereotypical problems : the natives are restless , his boss is a jerk , and now two man-eating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off . "
noreview,"patterson tries to handle the situation himself , incompetently , and then turns to charles remington ( michael douglas ) , a hunter of world reknown ( or something like that ) . "
noreview,"the movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions , they should have gotten top billing and co-starred with siegfried and roy . "
noreview,"they are nigh-invulnerable , as one comic book put it , and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature . "
noreview,give me a break . 
noreview,the movie hasn't got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas ; it's just trying to find convenient ways to stall us . 
noreview,even the lion hunts themselves are idiotic . 
noreview,"get this : remington's big plan is to build a large scaffold-like structure in the middle of the savannah , sit on it , and wait for the lion to show up . "
noreview,"he does this , and then gets knocked off by a bird . "
noreview,"by the end of the movie , the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand . "
noreview,the acting is forgettable . 
noreview,"douglas does a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow , but it's nothing he hasn't done before . "
noreview,"kilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else , somewhere else , and the rest vanish into the cinematography . "
noreview,"the camera , by the way , sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent . "
noreview,what did i expect from this movie ? 
noreview,i dunno . 
noreview,"some real excitement , i suppose . "
noreview,a sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation . 
noreview,no such luck . 
noreview,"i dug out my tattered copy of hemingway's "" the short happy life of francis macomber "" and read that to get the taste of this movie out of my mind . "
noreview,unfortunately it doesn't get much more formulaic than one tough cop . 
noreview,there's the renegade cop with the loser partner who has to many problems to explain . 
noreview,"the renegade has to prove his good name and is trapped between the good guys , the bad guys and some woman who really has nothing to do with the story other than being there for the purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film . "
noreview,"bo dietl ( pronounced deedle , baldwin ) is one tough cop , a guy who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his association with the ny mafia . "
noreview,"on top of that problem , he has a drunk , gambling addicted partner ( penn ) who has a penchant for collecting parking tickets ( i guess cops aren't immune ? ) . "
noreview,"then , throw into the mix the femme fatale ( gershon ) . "
noreview,right there you have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama . 
noreview,"but right in the middle of the film , they throw in a completely un-related plot point . "
noreview,dietl and his partner duke try to solve a case that they have been warned to stay away from . 
noreview,the film spends over half an hour tracking the case of a nun who was beaten and raped to near death . 
noreview,"once the case is solved , the film shifts focus back to the mafia issue . "
noreview,whatever neat mesh the screenwriter wanted to create between the two stories failed miserably . 
noreview,aside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as a mafioso ( an insult if you ask me ) the performances were pretty good . 
noreview,"baldwin , though he occasionally slips into an impression of his brother alec , does a fine job as one tough cop . "
noreview,"penn , who also slips into an impression of his brother sean , is even better as a loser tough guy cop . "
noreview,what one tough cop lacks is originality . 
noreview,this film offers nothing new . 
noreview,nothing that you can't get from any cop film . 
noreview,"it screams sidney lumet all over the place , perhaps because it was produced by marty and michael bregman , producers of lumet's dog day afternoon and serpico . "
noreview,but even the masterful sidney would not have been able to make one tough cop into a good film . 
noreview,too much else is lacking . 
noreview,"i also saw the boom mic pop into the top of the frame twice early on in the picture , something that i almost never notice . "
noreview,"but once i saw that , i had it in the back of my mind every time i saw a medium or long shot . "
noreview,"at times , i was hoping to see it . "
noreview,"one tough cop isn't laughable , nor is it a terrible film , but it just isn't unique . "
noreview,it is a classic example of a film that didn't need to be made . 
noreview,"but one thing is for sure , it could really use a better title . "
noreview,supposedly based on a true story in which the british drive to build a rail bridge deep in africa grinds to a halt after a pair of lions start killing off the workers in 1898 . 
noreview,"john patterson ( val kilmer ) , the bridge building expert set to oversee the operation , tried to rid his operation of the lions , but fails . "
noreview,"a world renound hunter , remington ( michael douglas ) , is called in and the battle , man against lion , begins . "
noreview,"this film has a great soundtrack , and wonderful scenery . "
noreview,the acting is not too bad except the characters are all so thin . 
noreview,we only see one side of each character . 
noreview,kilmer is a bridge builder and that's all we see him as . 
noreview,these lions kill dozens of his men and he doesn't even appear to be too upset about it . 
noreview,and the plot ? 
noreview,"it's jaws , but with lions . "
noreview,again we're presented with an animal that behaves not at all as it should . 
noreview,it appears to kill men because it just likes too . 
noreview,why ? 
noreview,who knows . 
noreview,i guess there wouldn't be much of a story if it didn't . 
noreview,the problem is that there isn't much of a story even though it does . 
noreview,of course i knew this going in . 
noreview,"why is it that whenever a tv-star makes a movie it's always a romantic comedy , and then they say on entertainment tonight or something , that they were "" attracted to the characters . "
noreview,"they were really original . "" "
noreview,"original ? ! let me give you a run-through of picture perfect : character a ) kate ( jennifer aniston , from tv's friends ) , a smart , beautiful , professional woman wants two things she can't have : a new job-title and the love of her co-worker kevin bacon . "
noreview,"her boss will only give her the job if she gets married and gets a mortgage and gets a lease on a german sportscar , and kevin bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls . "
noreview,what does she do ? 
noreview,she invents a fiance ! 
noreview,"then when everyone wants to meet him , she tells some poor schmoe she met at a wedding that she will pay him $1000 to pretend to be in love with her for a company dinner , and pick a fight with her at the end , thus breaking the engagement but still being able to keep her job , since the guy ends up looking like a jerk and she is the poor , defenceless female . "
noreview,"he , of course , goes along with it . "
noreview,"gee , i wonder if they get together in the end . "
noreview,i've seen more original stuff on the wb . 
noreview,and better stuff too . 
noreview,"picture perfect also makes the mistake of being _wayyyyy_ too long at 100 minutes , and expecting us to like aniston's character , who comes off as a cold , spoiled bitch . "
noreview,louie is a trumpeter swan with no voice . 
noreview,"in order to woo his lady love serina , louie makes friends with a young boy , sammy , who persuades teacher mrs . hammerbottom ( carol burnett ) to allow louie to attend class . "
noreview,"louie learns to read and write and returns to his flock , but is laughed at once again when no other swans can understand his message of love for serina . "
noreview,"to make matters worse , louie's father feels he's lost his honor because of the trumpet he stole for his son in this animated version of e . b . "
noreview,"white's "" trumpet of the swan . "" "
noreview,"as jane austen and henry james have become popular sources for adult filmmakers over the past decade or so , e . b . "
noreview,white is being returned to for children's films . 
noreview,"the animated "" charlotte's web "" has become a minor classic since its release in 1973 and 1999 brought us a live action version of "" stuart little . "" "
noreview,one of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles . 
noreview,"he has built a strong reputation with films like matewan and the secret of roan inish , and one of his best was his last film , lone star . "
noreview,"after sayles gave us this complex and unconventional look at ethnic tensions on the us-mexico border , expectation ran high for his next film . "
noreview,"unfortunately , his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for . "
noreview,we are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do . 
noreview,"then the film does exactly what it promised , a painful as that is . "
noreview,"the plot of men with guns can be summarized "" in a central or south american country things are really bad for everybody in the mountains where the army clashes with the guerrillas . "
noreview,dr . fuentes did not believe how bad things were so he went . 
noreview,"and he found out again and again and again . "" "
noreview,of course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell . 
noreview,a guerrilla war is always bad for civilians . 
noreview,but the film talks down to the viewer . 
noreview,dr . fuentes ( played by federico luppi ) teaches medicine in the capital city of his country . 
noreview,"he has , as a great humanitarian gesture , trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world a little better for the poor indios . "
noreview,fuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service . 
noreview,then he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs a squalid private pharmacy . 
noreview,in shame and disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others . 
noreview,"the student tells him the others are still in the mountains , but suggests that it may not be a good place to be . "
noreview,"fuentes goes off to find and visit the doctors , ignoring the advice of his family and a patient who happens to be an army general . "
noreview,the results are little different than one would expect . 
noreview,dr . fuentes starts out incredibly naive . 
noreview,"even some american tourists , present in the film mostly for comic relief , seem to know better than dr . fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains . "
noreview,but fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover how wrong he was . 
noreview,sayles certainly could have used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians . 
noreview,the cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences . 
noreview,federico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos . 
noreview,damian delgado makes a late appearance as an army deserter . 
noreview,mandy patinkin has a small role made to look bigger in the trailer . 
noreview,'traffic violation' dr . daniel's review of u-turn 
noreview,dr . d's rating : critical condition ( 
noreview,"okay , here's the deal . "
noreview,i'll be the first one to grant that everybody needs a day off now and then . 
noreview,i'll even go so far as to say that a vacation is a necessary part of doing any job well . 
noreview,"i mean , hey , i've been known to stretch a weekend into a three-day outing , if friday looks to be a slow day . "
noreview,"and if monday ain't looking like a pick-me-up , well , i've been known to give martha nell a call and say , "" do me a favor , sweetheart . "
noreview,"bump old man ferguson's boil lancing to tuesday morning , and tell miss audrey that i'll swing by her house monday evening and see if we can't get her trick knee back in line . "" "
noreview,"a simple sentence like that , and i've got a nice four-day fishing trip with the boys , or more often than not , a trip up to cherokee , n . c . , for jackpot bingo and assorted other mountain funnery . "
noreview,"but the point is , if you take a day off , do something different . "
noreview,"if you've worked yourself silly for months , relax a bit . "
noreview,sleep in . 
noreview,eat pancakes at noon . 
noreview,microwave an egg in its shell . 
noreview,watch pro wrestling with the sound off . 
noreview,listen to some barry white records at high speed . 
noreview,whatever . 
noreview,"but do not , under any circumstances , spend your vacation doing the same thing you do for a living . "
noreview,"and , if you do , don't make the final product look ten times worse than it would any other time . "
noreview,"because i do not want to hear your sob stories , oliver stone . "
noreview,"you apparently thought you needed a break from making "" important films . "" "
noreview,cool . 
noreview,so you found this hinky little book and decided to make it a movie . 
noreview,"that's cool , too . "
noreview,"but , ollie , old sage , do not take a good story and a hot cast and make one of the most pointless and worthless films of the decade . "
noreview,"i'm just eager to meet you one day , so i can buy you a stoli , look you in the eye and say , "" what in the wide world of sports were you thinking with u-turn ? "" "
noreview,and i'll stand there staring 'til i get a straight answer . 
noreview,"sean penn stars u-turn , as bobby , a drifter who's had some troubles a while back . "
noreview,"he's heading cross the desert minus two fingers when his mustang ragtop blows a radiator hose , stranding him in superior , arizona , held there by an "" ignorant , inbred , turtleneck hick "" of a mechanic named darrell . "
noreview,"while darrell puts a new hose on the ride , bobby walks into town to see what's cooking . "
noreview,"is it needless of me to say that superior , arizona , is not exactly the shiny scrubbed home of all things lovely ? "
noreview,probably not . 
noreview,"bobby meets up with grace ( jennifer lopez ) , who invites him back to her place , for drape-hanging and other domestic issues . "
noreview,"just as those issues are starting up , grace's husband , jake , storms in , looking like check-out day of the elks lodge convention . "
noreview,just beats bobby silly . 
noreview,"bobby takes to the road , only to meet up with jake again , and jake asks bobby to kill grace . "
noreview,"a little while later , grace asks bobby to kill jake . "
noreview,them murderous arizonians . 
noreview,gotta love 'em . 
noreview,"if any of this sounds familiar , congratulations . "
noreview,you win a kewpie doll . 
noreview,"the story is a straight shoplift of red rock west , a cult favorite a few years back from john dahl , maker of the phenomenal the last seduction . "
noreview,"but the contest doesn't end there , guys and gals . "
noreview,"we get steals from russ meyer movies , where everybody in town is horny and sweaty . "
noreview,"we get the town from bad day at black rock , minus the train , plus busty women who can speak . "
noreview,"look at any schwarzenegger film , and you'll see our hero , bobby , as bobby has a mudhole stomped in his keister a dozen times , has his ribs stove in at least fifteen times , gets bit by a tarantula , gets shot at , and ends up with vultures circling overhead , all the while getting up like he just got a shaving nick . "
noreview,bobby as terminator ? 
noreview,"stretch it a bit , and we have a five-finger discount from doc hollywood , where the whole story occurs because of car trouble , forcing the main character to stay at the mercy of the town and the mechanic . "
noreview,"okay , he's working from a book , so maybe ollie's not totally to blame for blatantly copping these ideas . "
noreview,i just expect a man who can make up an alternative history of the united states to be able to craft a few original ideas before exposing the negative . 
noreview,i just wish he hadn't brought a cast like this together for what amounts to a group toe-stub . 
noreview,"sean penn gives a great performance , and jennifer lopez and nick nolte are as on target as they can be , playing over-the-top caricatures of stereotype characters . "
noreview,the best thing about the movie is watching penn react to the madness around him and try to figure out exactly what the blankety-blank is going on . 
noreview,too bad it's not fun to watch when it's happening to us . . . while 
noreview,we sit through this mess of a film . 
noreview,u-turn is not a bad film if you're a fan of technique . 
noreview,it's the oliver stone you've always known . 
noreview,"robert richardson is his usual cinematographer , and rob and ollie know how to shoot a flick -- great camera angles , shifting viewpoints , wicked colors , nice looking pictures . "
noreview,but pictures of what ? 
noreview,i think i'd rather stare at a xeroxed envelope for two hours than try to figure out the tilt-o-whirl point of this loser film . 
noreview,"plot twists are one thing , repetition is almost unforgivable , and this is dang near as unforgivable as any movie i've seen in the past five years . "
noreview,"oliver , i know your body of work is nothing to sniff at . "
noreview,"you've been nice enough to limit us to only one doors movie , and films like platoon , jfk , wall street and nixon give us plenty to dig on . "
noreview,"your scripts are certainly respectable , your budgets are up there on the screen , and your actors don't dog it . "
noreview,"and i know that , maybe , with u-turn , you were just kicking back , just having fun . "
noreview,that's fine . 
noreview,but don't do that with a movie with the potential of this one . 
noreview,do some police academy sequel ( imagine that . ) 
noreview,"do a big comedy , like a remake of it's a mad , mad , mad , mad world . "
noreview,"but do not drop a limp u-turn out of your pocket and expect us to accept it as "" an oliver stone movie , "" and not question why it stinks like week-old snook . "
noreview,"there's a right way to have fun , and a wrong way to have fun . "
noreview,this was as wrong as you can get without going to jail . 
noreview,there are two things the american film industry should avoid at all costs . 
noreview,one is letting an ambitious actor convert one of his or her favorite novels into a feature film . 
noreview,two is never greenlight a sci-fi film starring john travolta . 
noreview,"to wit , we present the disaster that is battlefield earth . "
noreview,"a science-fiction opus starring the barbarino of the actors guild , battlefield earth should be shown only at maximum-security prisons when a prisoner is tossed in solitary for bad behavior . "
noreview,"sci-fi is always a tricky beast : tight script , a good director , an ensemble cast of decent actors , and the ability to suspend even the most difficult of disbeliefs . "
noreview,battlefield earth fails at achieving even one of these attributes . 
noreview,here's the `plot . ' 
noreview,the year is 3000 . 
noreview,mankind has been become an endangered species thanks to the conquest of a race of aliens called the psychlos ( sounds like either the latest clown act from cirque de soleil or a white rap group ) . 
noreview,a small band of humans dwell in radioactive caves located in the rockies in fear of the `demons' who dwell in the cities below . 
noreview,"the psychlos are strip-mining the earth for its resources and terel , played by travolta , is the head of security for the mining/slave base located in denver . "
noreview,"a young rogue named jonnie goodboy tyler , played with dramatic flair by barry pepper , ventures from the safety of the caves into the city to uncover the truth about the `demons . ' "
noreview,he is promptly captured and taken to the alien base . 
noreview,"after several attempts at escape , johnnie is placed in the middle of an underhanded subplot of terel's , involving circumventing gold from an exposed vein in the rockies to his own end . "
noreview,"jonnie , assumed leader of the mining slave group , then manages to attain all psychlo and human intelligence through a learning machine terel forces him to use . "
noreview,"then the story just runs along until jonnie teaches the rest of the humans the basics of trigonometry , the bill of rights , how to use a machine gun , and how to fly a harrier jet . "
noreview,"the whole mess concludes with a big , loud , obnoxious gun-and-plane battle that had me praying for the end credits . "
noreview,"roger christian , the director of this lumbering beast , must have rented dune , blade runner , planet of the apes , independence day , stargate , beastmaster , the airwolf episodes , the `v' miniseries , the matrix , and the omega man . . . "
noreview,and decided to steal every scene he could for battlefield earth . 
noreview,christian even shoots every scene in a weird dutch angle titled left or right for every frame of the movie ! 
noreview,and every scene in the movie ends with a middle wipe -- really . 
noreview,the psychlos reminded me of a cross between jamaican basketball players with bad teeth and bloated hands and klingon extras working the star trek convention circuit . 
noreview,travolta's acting hasn't been this bad since the experts or maybe perfect . 
noreview,jonnie goodboy tyler evolves into william wallace with lines like `you can have your freedom if you fight ! ' 
noreview,then there's the script : the film just never convinces you that the plight of jonnie in teaching his fellow humans to fight and `take back the planet' would be a difficult task to achieve . 
noreview,why ? 
noreview,because terel provides all the necessary tools to incite a revolt -- for no particular reason beside the fact that `humans are stupid . ' 
noreview,"terel may be right , you know . "
noreview,humans made this movie . 
noreview,"would you believe -- in real life , i mean -- that if you were julia roberts , that you'd be the ugly underdog to your sister , the creepy catherine zeta-jones ? "
noreview,let me tell you what reality is . 
noreview,"reality is that you are megastar julia fricking roberts and your brother is eric roberts , and he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across the sky in a golden chariot . "
noreview,that's reality . 
noreview,"america's sweethearts is the opposite of reality , a train wreck that tries to sell julia as a scruffy also-ran , presumably because she wears horn-rimmed glasses and used to be overweight ( uh-huh ) . "
noreview,"the plot follows two married , mega-movie stars , gwen and eddie ( zeta-jones and poor , poor john cusack , whose material gets worse every year ) , on the eve of their new star vehicle's release , a film called time over time . "
noreview,"the only problem : gwen and eddie have gone through a nasty separation , and the press and public have not been forgiving ( think meg and dennis ) . "
noreview,"gosh , and the director has vanished with the film , holding the only print hostage . "
noreview,"veteran pr agent lee ( billy crystal ) is called upon to clean up the mess , throwing a press junket in the nevada desert to woo them with the story of a possible reconciliation between the gwen and eddie , presumably distracting the stupid , stupid film critics into forgetting they haven't seen the movie at all . "
noreview, ( note to sony : any studio executive that thinks this plot is going to win points with the reviewing press needs to check into rehab . ) 
noreview,and did i mention gwen's sister kiki ( roberts ) is along for the ride ? 
noreview,and that she and eddie just might fall in love along the way ? 
noreview,"oh billy , you're a scamp ! "
noreview,the script you've co-written with peter tolan ( what planet are you from ? 
noreview,"and bedazzled -- need i say more ? ) is a roast of hollywood and celebrity , sure , but it's not a funny one . "
noreview,"yes , crystal tells us , hollywood is lying to our faces ! "
noreview,"if you are surprised by this , you might want to check on your subscription to people magazine . "
noreview,it's about to expire . 
noreview,"aside from a scant few zingers ( yeah , se ? or winces rules ! ) , "
noreview,"america's sweethearts' jokes aren't funny , its pace is choppy , and the whole affair comes off as a vanity project -- not for headlining star julia roberts -- but for billy crystal to deliver a bunch of lame punch lines that he wrote himself . "
noreview,"i didn't time it ( the movie's not that bad ) , but it's crystal who really has the most screen time and is the unequivocal focus of the film . "
noreview,"bad move , billy -- your jokes suck . "
noreview,"the crotch humor is outpaced only by the meanness of the movie's gags -- and with unsubtle sexual innuendo dripping from every scene , how this movie earned a pg-13 rating is a mystery to me . "
noreview,"julia overcame a lot of spiteful writing and acting to make my best friend's wedding into a winning film , but not even that 90-tooth smile can save her here . "
noreview,"obviously aware of the ugliness before him , director joe roth turns to goofy supporting characters like hank azaria ( as a lisping spaniard ) , christopher walken ( the insane time over time director ) , and alan arkin ( a new age guru in a fright wig ) to crack wise . "
noreview,none of the stereotypes is successful except for walken ; azaria comes off as a preening queen when he's supposed to be macho . 
noreview,"as for roth , in case you don't know , went from direcing revenge of the nerds ii to launching his own movie studio , revolution , which produced this work . "
noreview,he's back behind the camera for the first time in 11 years . 
noreview,it'll probably be another 11 before he's back again . 
noreview,"i could drone on about how america's sweethearts will only appeal to the mouth-breathing morons who talk on their cell phones during the movies , but that would get old . "
noreview,"instead , i'll settle for discussing the movie's worst sin : that sweethearts is painfully contrived and wholly unbelievable , not just in its plot but in its sentiment . "
noreview,"every single character in this film ( with the arguable exception of kiki ) is simply hateful , and putting them in a romantic comedy is a waste of a bunch of villains . "
noreview,"when you leave the theater , you'll ask yourself , too : why would i want any of these jerks to be happy ? "
noreview,"rated : r for strong violence , language , drug use , nudity , and some sexuality . "
noreview,"starring : wesley snipes , anne archer , michael chaykin , donald sutherland , marie matiko . "
noreview,running time : 117 minutes 
noreview,directed by : christian duguay 
noreview,i've never fully understood wesley snipes's career . 
noreview,"he has his ups and downs , but mostly the downs . "
noreview,"his best movie was one of the best of 1998 and that movie was entitled "" blade "" . "
noreview,"he has had his typical action movies , "" boiling point "" , "" passenger 57 "" , but his new movie "" the art of war "" should just be called "" rising sun 2 : the art of war "" cause basically it's a semi-remake of the same plot , with a different cast , and forced to be a ridiculously unbelievable thriller , that is high on style and low on substance . "
noreview,"wesley snipes plays a james bondish type secret agent working for the u . n . after a chinese ambassador is killed , he is on the track of the killer , trying to find out who it is , how it happened , where the killer was , and what to do . "
noreview,"anne archer plays his "" boss "" type person of the u . n . and she has hired snipes to track down the killer . "
noreview,"well snipes is mistakenly framed as the killer , and is now an outlaw , kidnapping a chinese woman with him , and having her help him along the way . "
noreview,"all this leads to a finale that is so dumb , and so stupid that is it unbelievably dumb , and the stunts , dialogue and acting all ruin this movie . "
noreview,wesley snipes isn't one of my favorite actors because of the fact that the character he plays in every movie is the same character he plays in the movie before . 
noreview,"the only good role snipes has really had was in 1998's "" blade "" . "
noreview,"i walked into "" the art of war "" expecting a good , high octane thriller , and all i got was a pile of mush . "
noreview,"the only real 'good' thing the movie has is action , and plenty of it , but i noticed it is badly filmed , the camera is so shaky you cannot even tell what is going on . "
noreview,"the ending finale is so worthless and pitiful , that it even tries to mock "" the matrix "" , laughably funny , it is undeniably stupid . "
noreview,christian duguay's direction is also not that great . 
noreview,"his camera angles and sense of style are all in place , but sadly his lighting and editing are all badly done . "
noreview,"even the whole "" matrix "" ending wasn't even good . "
noreview,"the stunts and action are badly filmed , and badly choreographed . "
noreview,"his placing of the characters , and the assination of the chinese ambassador , and the plotting of the movie are so predictable and laughable , that it just takes all the fun out of the entire movie . "
noreview,"anne archer who is usually good in her roles , turns in a horrible job here . "
noreview,"she is sour , downbeat , and dreadfully dull with her forced dialogue , and dumb moves . "
noreview,even donald sutherland as a co-star can't save this movie from being a bust . 
noreview,"so for an overall opinion : "" the art of war "" is a total waste of time . "
noreview,"it's not entertaining , nor exciting , or even action packed . "
noreview,"it is a pointless movie , and makes absolutely no sense at all . "
noreview,"if you really want to see a good version of "" the art of war "" , rent the wesley snipes and sean connery action vehicle of the same kind "" rising sun "" , it isn't a great film either , but at least it's better than this . "
noreview,"movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good , the bad , and the despicable . "
noreview,"i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in '95 , but i wanted to re-write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics . "
noreview,"we need to be warned about some truly awful films , too . "
noreview,"this picture was so bad , it inspired the description for my 1/10 rating ( see ratings chart below ) . "
noreview,the only thing saving it from a 0/10 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno . 
noreview,"so , it does indeed have some plusses . . . "
noreview,"in fairness , elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff . "
noreview,"and her ability to whine and irritate us , even while nude , was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone . "
noreview,"this character is not smart , not interesting , and ( deliberately ? ) "
noreview,far too annoying far too often . 
noreview,"like in 1998s "" bulworth "" , when the movie was over i didn't care one little iota about the main character . "
noreview,"at least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film , though . "
noreview,"mr . nice guy is the latest jackie chan film , so you should know what to expect . "
noreview,"a weak plot , terrible dialogue , very little acting ability , but some jaw-dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile . "
noreview,"however , mr . nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie's best efforts , and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever . "
noreview,"jackie chan plays , who else , jackie . "
noreview,"this time out , he's a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show . "
noreview,not that it ever makes a difference in the plot . 
noreview,there are only two scenes of him cooking . 
noreview,"for the rest of the film , somehow he mutates into jackie chan , supercop . "
noreview,it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills . . . perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege ? 
noreview,"a tv newswoman , diana ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) , covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo ( richard norton ) and a local gang of toughs , the demons . "
noreview,"although she only has one camcorder , somehow the result is full of close-ups and multiple angles . . . hmmm , "
noreview,shades of broadcast news ? ? ? 
noreview,"anyway , the goons discover diana , and will do anything to recover the tape . "
noreview,here lies another crucial flaw in the story : doesn't anyone realize you can copy a tape ? 
noreview,"oh well , no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense . "
noreview,"as luck would have it , diana runs across jackie , and , wouldn't you know it , jackie accidentally ends up with the tape . "
noreview,this leads to countless chase and/or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie . 
noreview,"in a move apparently designed to woo american ( and other english-speaking ) audiences , the film uses english as its primary language . "
noreview,"however , that doesn't mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie's recent americanized releases . "
noreview,"strangely , many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english , and poorly too . "
noreview,"whether this is just a very bad case of looping , an effort to minimize accents , or a simple case of nostalgia , it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie's dubbed films . "
noreview,"the plot in mr . nice guy is negligible , merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons . "
noreview,"but even though plots have always been second to the action in jackie's films , it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread . "
noreview,"look , if you have jackie chan playing a chef , why not use that to your advantage ? "
noreview,"watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen , beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts . "
noreview,the action is a mixed bag here . 
noreview,there's really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackie's films . 
noreview,"it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site , apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan . "
noreview,"the action in the film is neither jackie's best nor worst , but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes . "
noreview,the film's gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting . 
noreview,"once or twice , it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence . "
noreview,but to slo-mo jackie running ? 
noreview,"either this is a nod to the six-million dollar man , or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down . "
noreview,"if you've seen all of jackie's films and are in need of another fix , go ahead and see mr . nice guy . "
noreview,"however , if you're just in the mood for some good action , you'd be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work , such as supercop . "
noreview," first rule of fight club is , don't talk about fight club .  "
noreview,"this quote deals directly with my opinion of this film , because quite frankly , it's not even worth mentioning . "
noreview,director david fincher ( seven ) has completely gone over the edge . 
noreview,"with crude humor , an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture , i'm surprised i didn't walk out . "
noreview,this just goes to show that hype kills . 
noreview,"it's very rare that a film so hyped up as "" fight club "" turns out to be noteworthy , and this is no exception . "
noreview,the story goes like this . 
noreview,"edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions , until he meets marla ( helena bonham carter ) . "
noreview,"norton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle , when he spots her at a session that he also attended . "
noreview,"apparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like , literally living in pain . "
noreview,"why any person would think of such a thing is beyond me , but things do get worse . "
noreview,"norton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling , and it's on a plane that he meets tyler durden ( brad pitt ) . "
noreview,"the two men develop a bond , and go out to a bar , and by golly after they get drunk , the two pitiful characters fight . "
noreview,how do they come up with this stuff ? 
noreview,"anyway , their fighting catches other pathetic loser's attention , and a club is formed . "
noreview,"out of all this mess , there manages to lie a message . "
noreview,fincher shows us that society is like robots . 
noreview,"we work in our jobs doing things step by step , and want out . "
noreview,"our insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are , and we blame it on others . "
noreview,"call me crazy , but this is common knowledge . "
noreview,"i think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is , which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably . "
noreview,"even with two good actors , and a solid actress , they only manage to weaken the story . "
noreview,i couldn't help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp . 
noreview,it just shows how desperate the script is for attention . 
noreview,"i guess brad pitt was right for this role , because i felt like beating him up myself . "
noreview,"his bothersome and depressing character , made me disgusted at his 20 million fee . "
noreview,it only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more . 
noreview,helena bonham carter however really had no purpose . 
noreview,"she just popped up on screen , mumbled some lines , smoked and left . "
noreview,this continues for what seems like 6 hours . 
noreview,"the film drags on and my headache gets bigger , while "" fight club "" nears what i think might be the end . "
noreview,"unfortunately by then , the film hits rock bottom . "
noreview,"though the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes , it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace . "
noreview,"on a side note , the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film , that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer . "
noreview,fincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson . 
noreview,"concentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment , won't do any good if everything else is in need of support . "
noreview,"also , i'm afraid that immature men might respond to the film's violence . "
noreview,the last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult . 
noreview,"when the film ends , i'm just glad to get home and take some advil . "
noreview,"you'll either enjoy what the film has to offer , or agree with ed norton when he says "" this is so f * * * ing stupid . "" "

And unlike service Industry, we never get unwanted pressure from Sales, rather SysCloud Sales team always understands the technical complexity and provides constructive feedback which helps a lot in focusing on product development process seamlessly. Additionally, you get to work with a very energetic team which is always ready to take any challenge within short span of time+ flexible office hours"
review,"I have worked for SysCloud for almost 4 years(June'11 to Feb'15) and I would say, SYSCLOUD is the company where I have learnt so much in my professional career. I worked directly under the CEO and GM of the company. Its an awesome place to work for.  I see some commenting about a CEO , you should be of his level in your career to talk abt a person. I still inspire SysCloud's CEO and Entrepreneur (My role model) and wonder how can a person work so much with this much enthusiasm."

How many work places, will you feel that your contribution counts.OPPORTUNITIES unlimited. If you are willing to put your heart and soul.. Then, THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO. I get loads of challenging opportunities with matching rewards. The kind of exposure that you will get even at the early stages of your career is phenomenal.My work and product gets to compete with the best of SAAS world. What more will I want? When the customer appreciates or sees value in the small changes that I do to the application, feel accomplished."

Company is concerned about selling to new customers, not concern about retaining customers or good resources for the long term."
review,"I have been working in Microobjects for the past 5 years as a software engineer and all these years I am really enjoying my professional and personal life. I mentioned 'personal life' because we work for fulfilling our personal needs and commitments. So if someone is balancing his/her professional and personal life to a certain satisfactory level we can surely say that we achieved something in life. I have not seen any other company like MicroObjects to achieve the above stated fact. Every company has its pros and cons. If you readsome of the review of so called professional companies no one will even send the resume to them but then for a living you need a job. If someone has the habit of weeping for every issues he come across he will do the same even if employed with Goolge or even if he jobless!! I didt noticed, till date, any of my colleagues denied of his leave, which is very common in any software companies. So when you talk of flexibility it is not only the freedom to come and work as and you wish but also refers to you being available for your personal needs. Most of the 5 days working companies are just for name sake. I know many of my friends who are not even enjoying the Sundayswhereas in MicroObjects hardly people work more than 5 working days(in rare cases it happens i agree) Microobjects being located at the center of Kochi city, is the best place to looking after our every professional and personal needs.If MicroObejcts is not that a good place, I wonder Why more than 30% of employees resigned in the past are opting to come back!! So there is something which makes this company a favorite one even if we considers some cons.I read the previous review of an employee and am not completely against his observations (there is black-sheeps inside for sure). But one thing am sure that he/her is still an employee of the company!!! Even if we assume that he is an ex, after working for more than 10 years this person realised that Microobjects is not the place to work?? So please every employee of this wonderful company come together and help Microobjects grow more and more for the benefit of all employees and their families depends on it."

The previous management was let go because they couldn't align with company goals. New management is aligned with and appreciated by US office. 2. People used to get fired often and without any reason based on random personal opinions of previous management. Under new management an objective metric for measuring performance has been introduced, which helps in removing bias and decisions are now data driven rather than opinion driven. You can't improve what you cant measure is the new management philosophy.3. The Bias in previous management towards a particular team has been removed. Perfomers are appreciated irrespective of which team they belong to. 4. Performance Appraisal is now done on time and fairly for all teams, which was highly baised and unfair earlier."

review,"One of the rarest settings you'd ever come across in a corporate setting, where-in the company has a really big global presence in the industry and at the same time is not crowded with a lot of people where you might get lost in a sea of people. People from different functions recognize and address you by your first name. Definitely not a privilege you would enjoy at most of the other companies.Company embraces the principles of Agile and vests the entire power of decision making on the team. No hierarchy driven culture to dictate methods of execution. You have the power to create your own success!"
review,"This company has won many Workplace Excellence Awards. The company culture is geared towards technical and professional staff, Administrative (non-technical) employees are not considered as professional staff and are basically ignored making life/work balance difficult. Benefits are good and compensation is above average if you are in a technical or professional position. Plenty of job advancement for technical and professional - non-technical is underpaid for the duties required and title/salary are tied to your direct reporting manager. Company is top heavy in management and executive staff. Job Culture between employees is fair."

review,"This one is my second company and for me experience with current and previous company is really good. I really don't write blogs or review ( believe me not a single review even on flipkart products that i purchased so far :) ). This time someone is really spreading bad about the company so thought i should share my exp about Avalara.Pro's : If you are a positive minded person there are lots of thing that you can find opportunity into, but few are the bullet point which really reflects in day to day operations.- Company understands about today's trend about Husband and Wife both being working professional as a reason they provide free breakfast , Lunch and snacks (that too a good quality food). this really help's me as my wife as well is working.- Work from home option : My parents staying at native really require my attention once every 2-3 months and having this option really help me spend time and as well contribute to work.- There is a special budget allocated for team outings and that's really with individual team members to plan activities. Its really fun to go out with team enjoy the time.- I noted the salary is actually competitive per market standards ( if not why would have I been sticking with this company so far :) )- Work wise - this is product based company and you get to work on latest technology stack. Few bullet items i added to my Resume since last 12 months (AWS , Node.js and Angular JS).Overall I think this is a pretty good company for those who wants to keep learning and growing. This is not like a typical service based industry where you are guarded with a huge team and your performance hardly counts. This ones for individual contributors and for folks who keeps performing throughout. I think this is now a general trend in service industry as well , even if you are in group there are metrics to evaluate you individual performance."

noreview,steve buscemi's character-the wiseass-is exceptionally problematic . 
noreview," rockhound "" , as he's called , is sarcastic and foolish , so they tape him to a chair , where he spends most of the film . so why did they bring him up there to begin with ? rather , why write him into the film ? -give his almost-witty one-liners to serious willis , who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter , firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig . i'm guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel , at least in my world where the sky is blue . liv tyler is pretty and humourless , as always ; suspiciously , four of her father's band's ( "" aerosmith "" ) songs grace the soundtrack . director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick , like ketchup , eventually drowning the movie on-screen .  ( the middle hour is a non-sensical , pyrotechnic assault on the average primate's brain . ) whenever someone dies in this movie , a crew member inevitably yells out "" we lost ( insert dead person's last name here ) !  "
noreview,"i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil-guy-cum-astronaut from a live one , and close-ups of the corpses' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance , as their skin was often covered in fake blood . "
noreview,armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla . 
noreview,"it looks nicer , and has fewer plot-holes within its equally ludicrous framework . "
noreview,it has a vivid soundmix . 
noreview,"but at almost two-and-a-half hours , i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story . "
noreview,"the love story has been played up in the ads , perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic-fever . "
noreview,bollocks ! 
noreview,the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout-erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car-sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon-crawler . 
noreview,remember a little film called jaws ? 
noreview,"in this film , three independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark . "
noreview,"they didn't much like each other at first ; eventually , they started to respect one another . "
noreview,one of jaws' great scenes involved the would-be-ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories . 
noreview,"this is the sort of male-bonding foreign to bay or his producer , jerry bruckheimer , who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we'll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end . "
noreview,"not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances-i'd be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before "" action "" was called . "
noreview,"a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don't bare their souls , who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest-beating bravery . "
noreview,"to this , i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic , nor brave , nor smart , even : this team couldn't build a birdhouse . "
noreview,and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-a trailer for a movie written by a team of body-builders and greeting card authors-i've never been a prouder wimp my whole life . 
noreview,"there's a 1 , 000-foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact . "
noreview,"i'd say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies , which are getting more irwin allen- esque with every release . "
noreview,"the early wave of this revival , while just as cheesy and laughable , at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes . "
noreview,"deep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama , with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking . "
noreview,"the repeating cycle is as follows -- the president ( morgan freeman ) will go on tv and tell the country that there's a remote chance a comet will strike the earth , but that the nation's crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem . "
noreview,"then we get to see the plan in action , in some sequence utterly lacking suspense . "
noreview,"the mission will barely fail , and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth , and there's a remote chance it will strike , but that the nation's crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem . "
noreview,"it goes on and on throughout the movie , but every time freeman goes on tv , we know his plan is going to fail . "
noreview,how do we know this ? 
noreview,"because we've seen the tv ads for deep impact , ads that feature freeman telling the nation that "" the comet is still headed right for us "" and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading . "
noreview,"ladies and gentlemen , that is the movie . "
noreview,"successful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow , but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its 30-second tv spots . "
noreview,television is what's wrong with deep impact . 
noreview,"the main character , played by tea leoni , is a low-level broadcast journalist for msnbc ( and that's the mere tip of the product-placement iceberg ) who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy . "
noreview,"she thinks it's an instance of an ex-secretary of something or other ( james cromwell ) resigning because of a mistress , and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area . "
noreview,"when she goes nosing around cromwell , he begs her to keep it under wraps . "
noreview," i know you're just a reporter , but you used to be a human being .  "
noreview,"she figures out what's really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search , where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress and an extinction- level comet . "
noreview,"upon a top-secret meeting with president freeman , leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until the president can hold a press conference , at which she gets to ask the first question . "
noreview,"and everyone knows , if you get to ask the first question , baby you're a star . "
noreview,"leoni ends up in the anchor chair , broadcasting every step of the comet's collision course with earth . "
noreview,"and i'm sure it's comforting for her to know that , even though the world's ending in a matter of months , she's a cable news personality . "
noreview,"so there she is , narrating the six-astronaut mission to blow the comet up . "
noreview,"such personalities as robert duvall , jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this dragged-out process . "
noreview,"but as anyone who's seen the commercials knows , the astronauts fail . "
noreview,"they only end up breaking the comet into two pieces , which means even more destruction to the earth . "
noreview,"yeah , thanks , nasa . "
noreview,that's when freeman has to come on tv for the last time and say goodbye to all the people who aren't picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years . 
noreview,"they even have animals , two by two , ready to climb into the cave . "
noreview,"if the focus had been on people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed , deep impact could have been a far more interesting movie . "
noreview,"instead we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife , while people pack the highways out of town . "
noreview,"the reasoning is , of course , that if a comet is going to strike , they might as well be out in some scenic rural location . "
noreview,"and , amusingly , the highway is spotted with people in u-haul trucks . "
noreview,"i'm sure it's comforting to know that , even though the world's ending in a matter of minutes , the u-haul people are doing the most business of their lives . "
noreview,"late in down to you , the lead female character ( julia stiles ) states her greatest fear is having an "" artificial conversation "" with her boyfriend ( freddie prinze jr . ) . "
noreview,"the irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out , fallen asleep , or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy . "
noreview,the film is a multi-million dollar testament to everything artificial . 
noreview,"filled with characters , motivation , plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster . "
noreview,prinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles' freshman co-ed . 
noreview,"at first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of out-doing the previous in how "" cute "" it can be . "
noreview,"the happy couple "" psychoanalyze "" each other ; they pick out a song because , as prinze's dj mother ( lucie arnez ) explains , every couple needs a song ; he smells her shampoo ; she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love . "
noreview,"then , in standard romantic comedy style , things fall apart . "
noreview,why ? 
noreview,"well , because they have to . "
noreview,otherwise the couple can't make up and live ( presumably ) happily ever after . 
noreview,down to you exists outside the realm of normal logic . 
noreview,"scenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism , but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead . "
noreview,"a picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre , not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together , or even knowing each other , but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat . "
noreview,"the supporting characters are remarkably flat , and insultingly ridiculous as well . "
noreview,"stiles' best friend ( rosario dawson ) is a pot head , prinze's roommate ( shawn hatosy ) is a girl crazy fool who can't meet women , and then there are the porn stars ( zak orth and selma blair ) . "
noreview,"he is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television , does the college lecture circuit , and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film . "
noreview,"you know , the average porn star . "
noreview,"the costume epic idea gives him a reason to appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime he's on screen , the porn angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes . "
noreview,"she is a porn star mostly so we know she's slutty , so her very existence will make stiles jealous and prinze tempted . "
noreview,attempts at drama ( which means julia is going to cry ) include a pregnancy scare and the big break up . 
noreview,these characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes . 
noreview,what happened here ? 
noreview,"the cast is full of likable , promising , young actors ( stiles especially seems to be going places ) . "
noreview,writer/director kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off . 
noreview,"in fact the whole film feels like a reworking of last year's extremely unpleasant the story of us , for teen audiences . "
noreview,the direction is film-school-grad obvious . 
noreview,"it's stylish in a hugely self conscious way which throws in split screen , a pointless parody of "" cops , "" characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters , and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion . "
noreview,"plus , the whole story is told flashback style , narrated by prinze and stiles directly addressing the camera . "
noreview,this is the second film in a row ( following wing commander ) starring freddie prinze jr . which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of she's all that . 
noreview,if he doesn't start making better choices fast his future films won't be so lucky . 
noreview,"for better or worse , the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated , oversexed , underwritten thrillers . "
noreview,"apparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer doesn't change a thing , since body of evidence wasn't written by him , but has a puzzling eszterhas-ish presence all over it . "
noreview,"in other words , it's a ) really dirty and b ) really , really stupid . "
noreview,"madonna ( first warning sign ) stars in body of evidence as a woman who has piles of money and no apparent job ; she lives on a houseboat and likes to parade around semi-naked , presumably for the edification of the shrimp . "
noreview,she's been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover . 
noreview,"already two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect -- the first being that any woman in a movie cannot be sexual unless she's under thirty ( or at least looks it ) , and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men . "
noreview,"what's worse is that the movie confirms all the above , and wallows in them as well . "
noreview,madonna's character is accused of forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condition . 
noreview," ( and yes , there are the obligatory cracks from the cops about how at least he died happy . "
noreview,this movie leave no scummy stone unturned . ) 
noreview,anyway . willem dafoe ( very good but completely wasted ) also stars as the lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonna's sexuality . 
noreview,how do we know this ? 
noreview,because his character is set up with the token wife and kids . 
noreview,how obvious is it that he's gonna cheat on her and have to fess everything up ? 
noreview,and get kicked out of the house ? 
noreview,and get welcomed back anyway ? 
noreview,don't skip to the end yet ; we're just getting warmed up . 
noreview,dafoe and madonna have a lot of sex in this movie . 
noreview,"most of it is about as erotic as open-heart surgery , since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax ( always the kink of choice among screenwriters who don't know the first thing about * really * kinky sex ) and smashed light bulbs . "
noreview,don't ask . 
noreview,"another thing that people are starting to realize about explicit sex in movies is that unless it is critically important to the story , it's insanely dull . "
noreview,"what's worse is that body of evidence is dull * everywhere * , not just in the sex scenes . "
noreview,the stuff in the courtroom is recycled ninth-hand from other bad courtroom drama scenes . 
noreview,"the thriller business itself is ridiculous -- it involves nasal spray bottles and drugs , and juergen prochnow as a surly doctor . "
noreview,"and the ending -- another homage to eszterhas , maybe ? "
noreview,-- is one of those endings where you can almost see the exact * frame * where one of the five or six various endings to this mess was spliced in . 
noreview,"the director is uli edel , all the more disappointing since he also directed the elegiac and powerful last exit to brooklyn and christiane f . everyone has to eat , i guess , but this isn't a meal ticket , it's leftovers . "
noreview,it was with great anticipation that i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable . 
noreview,the academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed . 
noreview,"it also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers , james horner . "
noreview,what i was in for was a disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of 1995 . 
noreview,what drags braveheart down is its screenplay . 
noreview,"it abounds with high production values : john toll's award-winning cinematography ( which also graced edward zwick's 1994 legends of the fall ) , a gorgeous score by horner , and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names . "
noreview,but this does not save a misguided script . 
noreview,"the film wishes to paint its central character as a hero , but the viewer's only response to his "" heroism "" is intellectual : william wallace ( producer-director mel gibson ) is fighting for freedom and against tyranny , so we have to root for him . "
noreview,but wallace's actions paint a different story . 
noreview,he speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance . 
noreview,"though one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side , the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait , in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king . "
noreview,"wallace speaks of freedom , but his acts point toward vengeance . "
noreview,"after kicking the english out of scotland , he decides to invade england . "
noreview,"this is evident of a "" spartacus complex "" , and this example applies both historically and cinematically . "
noreview,"the historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities ; the film spartacus , like braveheart , has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay . "
noreview,it is a shame that such an excellent score is part of such a terrible film . 
noreview,"horner's score tries to make emotional connection , but the performances and the script do not help . "
noreview,gibson portrays wallace in such a way that the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him . 
noreview,"this drags down any emotional connection to the film's plot , and turns three hours into a total waste of time . "
noreview,"susan granger's review of "" the watcher "" ( universal ) "
noreview,"just what we need : another lurid , trashy serial killer saga . "
noreview,"this time , keanu reeves plays an elusive homicidal maniac who engages in a gruesome ticking-clock cat-and-mouse game with james spader , a burnt-out fbi agent who has suffered a traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years on the job with the lapd . "
noreview,"to taunt spader , who has relocated to chicago , reeves packs up his trusty piano wire and moves too . "
noreview,"before long , he starts mailing photographs of the lonely , unsuspecting young women who are his intended windy city victims , challenging spader , along with the chicago police department , to stop him within 24 hours before he strikes again . "
noreview,"in the midst of this murderous frenzy , there's spader's psychologist , played by marisa tomei , who is even less convincing as a medical professional than jennifer lopez in "" the cell . "" "
noreview,"writers david elliot , clay ayers and darcy meyers , along with first-time director joe charbanic ( helmer of music videos for reeves' band dogstar ) , dwell on the warped thrill of the methodology and the chase , revealing , early on , exactly whodunit since the killer says he and the cop "" need each other to give meaning to our lives . "" "
noreview,"plus , as reeves explains , "" we're all stacked right on top of each other , but we don't notice each other any more . "" "
noreview,"after that , it's all sound effects and tricky camera-work , along with a muddled , discordant soundtrack . "
noreview,"james spader's acting technique can be described as 'wooden deadpan' while keanu reeves maintains his perpetually monotone 'dude' persona which sometimes works , sometimes doesn't . "
noreview,"chris ellis , as spader's self-important colleague , is the only cast member who manages to be convincing . "
noreview,"on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" the watcher "" is an appallingly awful , amateurish 2 . the real torture is watching it . "
noreview,ahh yes . 
noreview,the teenage romance . 
noreview,"an attractive young cast is pitted into an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies , and in the end , the guy always gets the girl . "
noreview,"and with the arrival of the breakout hit `she's all that' last year ( followed by a long catalogue of imitators including `10 things i hate about you' and `drive me crazy' ) , the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity . "
noreview,along now comes `down to you' . 
noreview,"the folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize on the rabid `she's all that' craze with their latest project , which has the studdly freddie prinze jr . attached and all . "
noreview,only `down to you' doesn't have the ? unlikely scenario' mentioned above . 
noreview,"it is an extraordinarily ordinary romance - a dull , unattractive teen comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that we're accustomed to . "
noreview,this is the kind of romance that only giggly 12-year old girls will find convincing . 
noreview,"in strictly textbook fashion , college sophomore and aspiring chef al ( prinze jr . ) meets freshman artist imogen ( julia stiles ) . "
noreview,they hit it off like a couple can only in the movies . 
noreview,"from here , it's the standard boy-meets-girl , boy-loses-girl , boy-drinks-entire-bottle-of-shampoo-and-may-or-may-not-get-girl-back story . "
noreview,"the plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main characters , who are frequently taking part in activities that . . . . "
noreview,"well , only happen in the movies . "
noreview,"fortunately , the cast of `down to you' has a certain appeal . "
noreview,"freddie prinze jr . and julia stiles are an adorable couple , and when on screen together , they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie should have centered around . "
noreview,"zak orth , as the newly realized porn star monk , shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the film's intelligent dialogue . "
noreview,"rounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy ( `the faculty' ) , selma blair ( `cruel intentions' ) and ashton kutcher ( tv's `that 70's shows' ) . "
noreview,"even the fonz himself - henry winkler , the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia - has a welcome role as al's dad , the host of the popular cooking program `chef ray' . "
noreview,maybe the concept of `down to you' looked good on paper to draw such a crowd . 
noreview,"as a feature film , however , the finished product is bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely . "
noreview,"perhaps worst of all , `down to you' is not funny . "
noreview,the jokes are drawn from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired . 
noreview,"the characters on screen , often laughing at each other's goofy/embarrassing antics , seemed far more amused than the audience . "
noreview,even the giggly 12-year old girls had grown restless toward the end as they waited impatiently for the formula to run it's course . 
noreview,"the one mildly clever segment featured winkler and prinze jr . in a fantasy sequence called `cooks' , a `cops' take-off in which the father and son would storm houses and cook a decent meal for ? needy' families ( with the assistance of a fully-armed swat team , of course ) . "
noreview,"when this is the highlight reel , you know the remaining film could leave something to be desired . "
noreview,"in order to make a teen comedy work , you've got to have characters that show something by way of depth and identity . "
noreview,"`10 things i hate about you' actually featured characters who were more than walking flashcards , and the result was refreshing . "
noreview,no such luck with `down to you' . 
noreview,"it's just a textbook romance where , despite absurd circumstances , everything is bound to work out in the end . "
noreview,"and at the end of the whole clich ? d ordeal , the nicest thing you could possibly say would be ` . . . . "
noreview,only in the movies' . 
noreview,"over 40 years ago , a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira , a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind's nuclear testing . "
noreview,"partly flight of fancy , partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry , gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo . "
noreview,"a year later , gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things : a new name , a dubbed english track , and raymond burr . "
noreview,"as godzilla , the film took on the rest of the world . "
noreview,"thirty years later , toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things ( yes , including raymond burr ) and called it godzilla 1985 . "
noreview,"now it's 14 years after toho's remake , and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run . "
noreview,"in emmerich's godzilla , matthew broderick plays dr . niko tatopoulos , a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiation-induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms . "
noreview,"when the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river , tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states . "
noreview,"meanwhile , tatopoulos's college girlfriend , audrey timmonds ( maria pitillo ) , works in new york city as an assistant to a big-time news reporter . "
noreview,"she'd like to be a reporter herself , and when godzilla comes ashore , she figures this is her big break . "
noreview,"of course , with the big guy running amok in the city , niko and audrey are bound to cross paths , and are joined by victor "" animal "" palotti ( hank azaria ) , audrey's trusty cameraman friend , and phillipe roche ( jean reno ) , an operative for the french government , whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place . "
noreview,together they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla . 
noreview,"with the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation's premiere movie production companies , one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla . "
noreview,he didn't . 
noreview,"right up there with the lost world , godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history . "
noreview,"the plot is pretty much what we expect : the big dinosaur-like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city , and it's up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped , while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down . "
noreview,"the script , however , is painfully bad . "
noreview,"it's fraught with lines so corny , they don't even belong in b-movies , and includes many character actions which make you think , "" you idiot , "" or "" you stupid girl . "" "
noreview,"i suppose when you've got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york , any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well . "
noreview,"why is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them , but is conveniently able to leap atop others ? "
noreview,"why do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him , when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line ? "
noreview,"why do sidewinder missiles , which have small explosive warheads , blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla ? "
noreview,"why is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f-18 fighter-bombers , when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two ? "
noreview,"okay , maybe the last one was a bit nit-picky , but hey , i was on a roll . "
noreview,"broderick is usually a good actor , but in this film he's weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way . "
noreview,"hank azaria does what he can , but don't expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage . "
noreview,"like broderick's , azaria's character is quite simply lacking in color . "
noreview,"what really annoyed me was maria pitillo , who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting . "
noreview,casting must have been asleep on this one . 
noreview,"the one bright spot here is jean reno , who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic , quite unlike what we've seem him do in the past . "
noreview,"although his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster , reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable . "
noreview,"unfortunately , the same cannot be said of the other incongruities . "
noreview,"the entire feel of the movie is tongue-in-cheek , and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it . "
noreview,"this results in a significant amount of parody , which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster , and ends up just producing a mess . "
noreview,"most of the characters seem to be there for comic relief , and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously . "
noreview,"although emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture , what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens ? "
noreview,"if we can't take the characters seriously , the threat they face is an empty one because we simply don't care what happens to them . "
noreview,godzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more light-hearted than it should be . 
noreview,"far be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters , but here's a behemoth running through the city ! "
noreview,"there's bound to be a lot of casualties , but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after-school g . i . "
noreview,"joe cartoon syndrome , where almost everyone seems to get out of harm's way just in time . "
noreview,"in a couple of scenes , godzilla briefly breathes fire . "
noreview,"none of the characters even remark upon this ability , nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers . "
noreview,"it's as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes , godzilla can do this , just like in the old movie . "
noreview,consider another punch pulled . 
noreview,"through creative script writing , you can make a sequel out of just about any movie , but the final scene in this one doesn't just leave the door open , it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently . "
noreview,it made me want to gag . 
noreview,emmerich should have done away with 90% of the humor and in-jokes and played this one as a straight action film . 
noreview,"with an intelligently written screenplay , godzilla could have been so much more . "
noreview,"however , by confusing the viewer with a ton of add-ins and parodies , the movie ends up being something that just doesn't work . "
noreview,now if they only had raymond burr . . . . 
noreview,"before the remake of psycho appears , we've got to suffer through this remake of an earlier hitchcock film , dial m for murder . "
noreview,"as usual , hollywood has filled it with glitz and big name stars , and it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing . "
noreview,the film opens with emily ( paltrow ) and david ( viggo mortensen ) 'having fun' in an loft apartment . 
noreview,"the problem is , paltrow is married to stephen ( douglas ) , who is not too happy when he discovers this affair . "
noreview,"if i was paltrow , though , i'd definitely go with mortensen . "
noreview,less wrinkles . 
noreview,"anyhow , stephen approaches david with an interesting proposition : he'll pay him to kill his lovely wife . "
noreview,"mortensen agrees , but the murder goes awry , and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses . "
noreview,"unfortunately , the film dosen't progress very fast . "
noreview,"in fact , it moves like a tortoise with arthritis ( read : very , very s-l-o-w . ) "
noreview,"the plot moves nowhere fast , and only becomes exciting in very short bursts . "
noreview,not too good for a 'thriller . ' 
noreview,"also , the performances , apart from douglas , are below par . "
noreview,"paltrow , showing immense talent in se7en ( 1995 ) and sliding doors ( 1997 ) is strangely stilted , even unconvincing , in this movie . "
noreview,"mortensen is a little bit better , coming across as a younger douglas , but his role isn't meaty enough to show all his talent . "
noreview,"which leaves douglas to waltz away with the film , which is does . "
noreview,"however , i doubt douglas finds it very hard to play a stogie smoking , drinking womanizer with a creepy underside . "
noreview,"also popping up in the film is david suchet , playing a shifty looking detective . "
noreview,"again , it's not a character we're seeing on the screen , it's david suchet . "
noreview,"the director , who bought us the fugitive , piles on all the flash techniques , such as zoom-in's , quick cuts , etc . the lighting is also interesting . "
noreview,"however , looks can't save this film from the depths of mediocre , and the film seemed to work better in a single set anyway . "
noreview,"the screenplay is o . k , but there's some hackneyed sub-plot about douglas being a ruthless player on wall street ( again ) and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched . "
noreview,"the characters also make incredibly dumb moves , especially paltrow , and stephen appears to lose all intelligence in the last reel . "
noreview,"with a combination of no tension , drama , or decent characters , a perfect murder is a failure all round , and an incredible disappointment . "
noreview,"there are a few bright moments , but they are far and few between . "
noreview,"the last thing a thriller should be is boring , and although the film just barely manages to keep your interest thanks to michael douglas , you wouldn't be missing anything if you decided not to watch a perfect murder . "

noreview,review by david wilcock ? 1998 
noreview,"coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers , relentless , 1989 low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz , played by character actor leo rossi , spawned three more sequels . "
noreview,"relentless 3 , third in the row , features sam dietz again , but this time detective , who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case , doesn't want to deal with similar line of work . "
noreview,"divorced , demoralised and transferred , he reluctantly returns to his old post when los angeles becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer , and evidence indicate connection with one of dietz's old cases . "
noreview,"to make things even more interesting , it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation . "
noreview,fans of the british tv films and mini-series like prime suspect or cracker would probably see a lot of similarities relentless series of movies . 
noreview,"they both feature vicious psychopathic killers , yet also give a lot of , usually depressive , details about chief investigator's private lives . "
noreview,"this one isn't an exception , but similarities with british television are only in content . "
noreview,"the execution and style is different , which makes this film mediocre piece of entertainment at best . "
noreview,"useless , gratuitous erotica also doesn't help either , obviously making this film longer than it should be . "
noreview,"the actors are good , though - leo rossi is fine as usual , and william forsythe plays one of more compelling villains in his career . "
noreview,"signy coleman as dietz's love interest , is , on the other hand , quite miscast . "
noreview,"but she won't have to worry about it in the future career , since relentless 3 wasn't supposed to be anybody's finest moment anyway . "
noreview,"edward burns tackles his third picture with no looking back , and like his previous two , it is a working-class relationship picture . "
noreview,"however , unlike his previous work , the film dwells on a more personal story , and with a female protagonist . "
noreview,"and in no looking back , he stumbles , making a slow , boring film without the spark that enlivened his previous work . "
noreview,claudia ( lauren holly ) is a small town waitress who is feeling stifled by her life . 
noreview,"she's at a turning point in her life , and feels as if she's going nowhere . "
noreview,"her boyfriend , michael ( jon bon jovi ) , is broke and in a dead end job . "
noreview,"if she were to marry him , she'd never get a chance to escape this town . "
noreview,"enter charlie ( edward burns ) , claudia's old flame . "
noreview,"he skipped town several years before , without any explanations . . . even "
noreview,for claudia . 
noreview,"he has come back to town to see her , and suddenly she is torn . "
noreview,"should she stay with stable michael , and never escape her hometown . . . or "
noreview,should she ignore her instincts and fall for charlie again . 
noreview,"part of the answer lies in the character of her mother ( blythe danner ) , who fell for the wrong man . . . and has spent her life pining for claudia's father to return . "
noreview,now it seems that claudia is about to make the same mistakes . 
noreview,"at only a little past ninety minutes , no looking back is rather short for its genre . "
noreview,"unfortunately , it seems much much longer . "
noreview,"the storyline is simple and uninspired , and there's a lack of energy to the whole proceedings , which makes the entire drama rather tedious . "
noreview,edward burns makes a misstep by casting himself in the crucial role as the egomaniacal old flame . 
noreview,"there's no one to restrain his ego , which reigns unchecked . "
noreview,"he walks into the room and lauren holly swoons . . . yeah , "
noreview,right . 
noreview,lauren holly does what she can with her central character . 
noreview,but we never understand why her character makes such pathetically bad decisions . . . and 
noreview,we never really care . 
noreview,bon jovi is the only sympathetic character in the whole movie . 
noreview,"his acting talents are much greater than they might seem , but he is given a mostly bland and ineffective role to work with . "
noreview,there's not much to recommend in no looking back . 
noreview,it's not that the film is bad . . . it's 
noreview,simply boring . 
noreview,"there's no zest in any aspect of the film , and no reason to spend ninety minutes watching it . "
noreview,i don't expect much from eddie murphy these days . 
noreview,"for the past four years , the gods of cinema--or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates--have allowed him to make one bad movie after another . "
noreview,"such films as metro , doctor dolittle , holy man , life , and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed-up hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures . "
noreview,"the biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film , nutty professor ii : the klumps . "
noreview,"the klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump , an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places . "
noreview,"sherman has just invented a new "" youth drink "" that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time . "
noreview,janet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor ( and for the most ridiculous reasons ) . 
noreview,"with love on his mind , sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego , buddy love from the first professor , who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers . "
noreview,"with some convoluted mumbo-jumbo about dna extraction , sherman extracts the "" buddy love "" link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy-dandy lab beaker . "
noreview,"but one night , the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated . . . "
noreview,because every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy . 
noreview,"then the klump family , all played by eddie murphy , step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex , flabby breasts , a slew of fart and dick jokes , and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes . "
noreview,and did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster ? 
noreview,the movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world -- with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene . 
noreview,"pure and simple , the klumps is a failure . "
noreview,"its script was handled by not one but five screenwriters , and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes . "
noreview,any sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process . 
noreview,"it's more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz , the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade , american pie , have their names stamped to this trash . "
noreview,hey guys - quick note - keep this movie off of your resumes . 
noreview,"the characterization of sherman's family , the klumps , is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema . "
noreview,everyone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough . 
noreview,the grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts . 
noreview,"the father is gruff , is fired from a blue-collar job , is sexually inadequate , and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings . "
noreview,the mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone . 
noreview,the brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood . 
noreview,sherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to . 
noreview,but the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy . 
noreview,the family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct . 
noreview,and you got the feeling that these crass people couldn't act like this all the time . 
noreview,"the sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt , making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic . "
noreview,"after a while , their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story . "
noreview,its also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker -- who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london -- and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line . 
noreview,even the best effects can't seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days . 
noreview,"now that i think about it , the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make . "
noreview,people will be lined up around the block for it . 
noreview,the studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2002 . 
noreview,"eddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles , but he'll play every character in the movie . "
noreview,i just can't wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself . 
noreview,"brian de palma , the director who bought us carrie , dressed to kill and mission : impossible is back , and has bought all his technical expertise with him . "
noreview,"sadly , he forget to bring a good story and believable characters . "
noreview,"nic cage plays rick santaro , a fast talking cop who is watching a boxing match with his friend commander kevin dunne ( sinise . ) "
noreview,"an assassination takes place , and santaro tries to peace together how it took place , trying to work out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy . "
noreview,the film uses flashbacks and video cameras to bring the mystery together . 
noreview,"however , the film doesn't keep the mystery for long , and once the big 'secret' is out concerning kevin dunne , the film is at a dead end . "
noreview,"although there are some fantastic shots by de palma , including a 15 minute steadicam shot at the start of the film , halfway through the film drops dead . "
noreview,the problem is that de palma doesn't have a strong story or characters to work with . 
noreview,"he tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techniques , but pretty soon this has no effect on the audience , and i quickly got bored . "
noreview,"nic cage and gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters , but it's no use . "
noreview,"they are boring , faceless , and completely unlikeable . "
noreview,"yes , another problem with the film is that there's no-one to root for . "
noreview,"we're supposed to be on cage's side , because his character becomes nicer throughout the film . "
noreview,"however , his change is sadly unbelievable . "
noreview,"poor gary sinise's character is terrible , who completely changes throughout the start , the middle and the end , in an appalling way . "
noreview,the film's use of flashback quickly gets boring . 
noreview,"while clever and interesting the first few times , it quickly becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used because the film has nowhere to go . "
noreview,they certainly don't increase the tension or suspense of the movie . 
noreview,"there is small thread of suspense running through the film , but it certainly doesn't make this film a powerhouse thriller , rather just a slightly below average one . "
noreview,"the script is lousy and contrived , the characters flat and two dimensional . "
noreview,certainly not good factors for a film passing itself off for a thriller . 
noreview,the most depressing aspect of the film is that it had potential . 
noreview,"there's a good story buried in snake eyes , it's just bogged down in razzle dazzle and flashbacks . "
noreview,"it also gives itself away far too quickly , rather than leaving the big twist for the end . "
noreview,"while the performances are intriguing , especially by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy 'number cruncher' wrapped up in the case , there's no way of altering the fact that snake eyes is a terminal case of style of substance , and unless you're a big fan of either cage or flash directing , should be avoided .

noreview,a david wilcock review ? 1998 
noreview,it's now the anniversary of the slayings of julie james' ( jennifer love hewitt ) best friends . 
noreview,"still besieged by nightmarish memories of the man responsible for it all , she seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown . "
noreview,"she can't concentrate on her schoolwork , can't get a good night's sleep , and is even frightened by the shadows and the blinking strobe lights at a local dance club . "
noreview,"everywhere she looks , she sees visions of the man in a rubber slicker with the hook on his hand . "
noreview,"in the first movie , `i know what you did last summer' , julie and three of her friends accidentally kill a man , running him down while driving down a dark mountain highway . "
noreview,"to cover their misdeed , they dump the body into the ocean . "
noreview,"however , he never quite died and returned to hunt down julie and her friends . "
noreview,"julie and one other , ray ( freddie prinze jr . ) , survived only to make this dismal sequal . "
noreview,"needing some desparate rest and relaxation , she is elated to learn that her college roommate , karla ( brandy ) , has won a trip for four to a secluded tropical island . "
noreview,"accompanying these two girls are karla's overbearing boyfriend , tyrell ( mehki phifer ) and a potential beau for julie . "
noreview,but was this contest too good to be true ? 
noreview,the resort is filled with a skeleton staff that seemed like love boat rejects . 
noreview,"meanwhile , the hotel is practically deserted as the storm season is about to begin . "
noreview,this presumably creates a venue where they will be secluded and will have no possible means off the island . 
noreview,"eventually , they will be hunted down during power outages and chased around during intense lightning storms . "
noreview,"as you might have guessed , somewhere in the shadows lurk a mysteriously strange figure that is wearing a rubber slicker and wielding a hook . "
noreview,"julie tries to convince her friends that the killer is on the island ( an eerie touch is when she is singing "" i will survive "" at the karaoke bar and the words scroll "" i still know . . . "" ) , but her friends chalk it up to paranoia . "
noreview,"but the body count soon starts to rise , and for julie , it's going to be the worst vacation of her life . "
noreview,"the funny ( yes , i used the word 'funny' ) thing about this movie is that i heard more chortling and giggling ( maybe it was my giggling ) than i heard screaming . "
noreview,this movie boils down to a mindless slashfest that never conjures up any amount of wry wit or even a quirky campiness . 
noreview,there isn't even any suspense that leads up to the deaths . 
noreview,here's an appropriate example . 
noreview,knock-knock . 
noreview,"lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4 : episode 1 is a boring , empty spectacle that features some nice special effects . "
noreview,after the familiar 'a long time ago . . . . ' 
noreview,"opening , the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game . "
noreview,"the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo , ruled by queen amidala ( portman ) jedi knights qui-gon ( neeson ) and obi wan ( mcgregor ) are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade . "
noreview,"however , this simple blockade is not all it seems , and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers , including facing the evil darth maul ( ray park . ) "
noreview,"they also meet the future darth vadar , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) "
noreview,"star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking : script , direction and characters . "
noreview,the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic . 
noreview,"the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star , and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more non-existent . "
noreview,"there's no underlying tension , and no urgent need to see what the outcome is . "
noreview,"the film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story , which doesn't help . "
noreview,"there's no snap to make the film work , it moves at a plod . "
noreview,"the script is boring : all the characters speak in morals , especially anakins mother . "
noreview,"there's no group spirit evident here , and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders , it's evident that not much is going to happen . "
noreview,"the two leads are hideously boring , static characters given little to do and too much time to do it . "
noreview,"qui-gon and obi-wan hold no presence on film , and give little for the audience to root for . "
noreview,"the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul , if he had been given more screen time . "
noreview,"maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history , even if he does provide the only 'straight' plot line in the film ( all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy . ) "
noreview,"anakin is annoying and unlikeable . , "
noreview,instead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended . 
noreview,"it's probably not surprising that his hateful little boy , unfortunately blessed 'ani' by everyone he knows , joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible . "
noreview,"the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks , although in the end none is provided in the film by him . "
noreview,"although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys , the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny . "
noreview,"the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a 'pod' racer , because i knew he wouldn't be able to talk for a while . "
noreview,"queen amidala is a nothing in the film , she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must 'serve her people , ' and go goo-goo over anakin . "
noreview,"again , her role will become more important in the later episodes , and is given little to do here . "
noreview,the actors don't help the movie much either . 
noreview,"liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed , and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible . "
noreview,"mcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy , with little charm . "
noreview,the casting director must have chose him because he's scottish like alec guinness : there's little other explanation for it . 
noreview,"natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script , but she delivers a spunky performance . "
noreview,and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice . 
noreview,"there's very little talent evident with him , it's hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there . "
noreview,he's not even very 'cute . ' 
noreview,"the main claim of the film , the special effects , are okay . "
noreview,"there's nothing impressive about them , yet they complement the story well . "
noreview,"the cgi takes away much of the human element , however . "
noreview,"the battle droids for example , the replacement for the stormtroopers , are characterless little computer graphics , lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers . "
noreview,episode 1 is just disappointing . 
noreview,"it's got high production values , but little else . "
noreview,"the music is meandering , except near the end . "
noreview,"the plot gives us no-one to root for , or even care for . "
noreview,"the effects are nice , but dull . "
noreview,the plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should . 
noreview,"there's an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair , and many clich ? s are catered for throughout the film . "
noreview,"apart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence , episode 1 is a dry affair that serves little purpose , except to make money and to get us to watch episode 2 to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film . "
noreview,disappointing is barely the word .

noreview,five girls spend a day in a closed building doing inventory when a strange box gets delivered there ( is this starting to sound familiar ? ) by mistake . 
noreview,"the girls accidentlly open the box ( big surprise , huh ! ) and release an evil spirit of a killer that kills the girls off one by one ( betcha didn't see that one coming ! ) . "
noreview,"hard to die , i found out while watching the film , is a sequel to sorority house massacre 2 : nightie nightmare ( r . a . m . r . # "
noreview,1521 ) . 
noreview,"two of the actresses from sorority house massacre 2 are in this film , robyn harris and melissa moore , but they play different characters here . "
noreview,"orville ketchum is also back as ( get ready for this ) orville ketchum ( yes , the same character from number two ) . "
noreview,"yes , he is also built like a tank in this film too . "
noreview,"i'm telling you , a nuclear bomb detonated next to this man wouldn't harm him at all ! "
noreview,"the before mentioned three were the only actors from part two that i thought could act , well they seemed to have lost that ability . "
noreview,"thankfully , for my sanity , i also saw the film warlock , which undid all the ill effects that i got from this film . "
noreview,the story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks . 
noreview,any good moments that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story line . 
noreview,"the film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has already been figured out , analyzed , and discarded before it happens . "
noreview,there is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot . 
noreview,"while we are on the subject of the story , the story also provides every chance it can to disrobe an actress . "
noreview,the film goes to the extent of putting a shower in the manager's office . 
noreview,"i'm sorry folks but this is completely unnecessary , ridiculous , and hurts the story more ( if that is still possible ) . "
noreview,the script for this film is completely pathetic . 
noreview,the lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible . 
noreview,the only thing that i think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they went along . 
noreview,here is an example of the wonderful dialog . 
noreview,the scene is two girls have just entered a gun store and have picked out a * really * big gun . 
noreview,"the line is "" my dad used to be a marine , i bet i can work it . "" "
noreview,this line has got to be a contender for the bad line hall of infamy . 
noreview,"now , we fast forward for a few minutes until just after a big plan ( ? ! ! ? ) has been presented . "
noreview,"one comment from an actress is "" not a lot of strategy involved , but i like it . "" "
noreview,i'm afraid folks that this is about as good as they get . 
noreview,now lets talk about the great special effects for this film . 
noreview,this obviously wasn't a big concern of the film makers . 
noreview,the killing scenes are so obviously faked that they go to the point of threatening the viewer's intelligence . 
noreview,a girl gets hacked with a knife and enough blood comes out to do one friday the 13th movie . 
noreview,are we trying to see how unrealistic we can get ? 
noreview,the continuity department was obviously asleep ( along with the viewers ) when watching this film . 
noreview,"in one shot , actress has cloths on , camera angle changes , actress seems to have lost clothing . "
noreview,very impressive trick ! 
noreview,the one ( half ? ) 
noreview,"plus that this film has going for it , is that in many places it is unintentionally hilarious . "
noreview,"the incompetence behind the film makes it incredibly funny , and so the viewer can get some enjoyment ( ? ! ! ? ) from the film . "
noreview,"however , this doesn't make it worth the rental fee of over a penny . "
noreview,"in the acting department , the only thing i can say is two thumbs squared and one head down . "
noreview,"i would normally do a detailed paragraph on this topic , but there is no point here because there is nobody that i was impressed with in the least . "
noreview,"oh well , win some , lose some . "
noreview,"the first film produced by adam sandler's happy madison production company ( clever title eh ? ) is essentially a one joke movie , much like the movies sandler stars in himself . "
noreview,however the difference here is that this one joke just isn't very funny . 
noreview,"rob schneider stars as the title character , a scruffy fish tank cleaner who ends up becoming a "" man-whore "" to raise enough money to replace a wealthy client's custom made fish tank , which deuce destroyed while staying in his home . "
noreview,"deuce goes on numerous "" dates "" , and each woman he goes out with has a "" humorous "" quirk about herself . "
noreview,"one has narcolepsy , one has tourette's syndrome , one is a man . . . "
noreview,etc . etc . 
noreview,"my problem is that we see all of these women in the film's trailer , so why do i need to watch the movie ? "
noreview,seen the trailer . . . 
noreview,seen the film . 
noreview,only a quick cameo from norm macdonald ( and a follow up joke during the closing credits ) generates any chuckles . 
noreview,deuce bigalow : male gigolo is available on dvd from touchstone home video ( a division of di$ney ) . 
noreview,"the disc includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , and features the original theatrical trailer ( as well as trailers for mystery alaska , happy texas , and outside providence ) , an extremely brief production featurette ( which contains footage not used in the film ) , and storyboard-to-scene comparisons . "
noreview,"yep , you read that right . . . "
noreview,there are storyboard comparisons on this dvd . 
noreview,two scenes are storyboarded . . . 
noreview,neither of which are particularly exciting . 
noreview,"there are fight scenes in this movie , so why aren't we seeing storyboards of those segments ( especially the parody moments from the matrix ) ? "
noreview,i wonder what's funnier : the fact that any moment in this film required storyboards or that di$ney thought fans of this film would want to see them ?

noreview,tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie . 
noreview,"the film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage , and , while it's evident that this could be a fascinating live production , the translation to the screen is a creative disaster . "
noreview,enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious . 
noreview,the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium . 
noreview,"tectonic plates has a storyline , although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences . "
noreview,"it's not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all-but-screaming , "" look ! "
noreview,"art ! "" ) , "
noreview,although it keeps the audience distanced from the characters . 
noreview,"because we're constantly made aware that we're watching a play or a movie , it's impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer's ideas . "
noreview,"they're not real , sympathetic , or believable . "
noreview,"i'm willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different , but this particular experiment is not a success . "
noreview,"tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac ) , an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor , jacques ( lapage ) . "
noreview,"one day , he disappears , and , fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love , madeleine travels to venice to kill herself . "
noreview,"while preparing to commit suicide , she encounters drug addict constance ( celine bonnier ) , who causes madeleine to re-think her decision . "
noreview,"meanwhile , jacques has moved to new york city , where he starts cross-dressing , calls himself jennifer , and becomes a successful counter-culture talkshow host . "
noreview,"with settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland , supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf/mute , and cultural references that point to chopin , george sand , and jim morrison , tectonic plates is unique , if nothing else . "
noreview,"however , as interesting as the film sounds ( and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising ) , it never really delivers . "
noreview,"the tone is soporific , the supposedly-intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting , the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner ( although it doesn't take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant ) , and the symbolism is obvious . "
noreview,"tectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth , but it takes one-hundred minutes to get across this transparent point . "
noreview,"there are some worthwhile moments , such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages ( although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren't bilingual ) . "
noreview,"the only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because ( a ) it's different , ( b ) it's not like anything they've seen before , and ( c ) it's pretentious . "
noreview,"for everyone else , it's not only a waste of time , but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage . "
noreview,various films seen at the seattle film festival : 
noreview,"it's all true/three men on a raft ( u . s . a . , 1942/1986 ) director : orson welles "
noreview,"a recently uncovered one-fourth of orson welle's planned "" docu-drama "" of amazing stories around the world named it's all true , this short dealt with welle's attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft . "
noreview,"while several clips of the film are seen , the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle's attempts to film it , despite studio problems , a staggering workload , and extremely ill fortune on the set . "
noreview,"impressive photography , but really only interesting to film historians . "
noreview,"sadie thompson ( u . s . a . , 1928 ) director : raoul walsh screenwriter : raoul walsh , from the john colton play "" rain "" , based on w . somerset maugham's story "" miss thompson "" cast : gloria swanson , raoul walsh , lionel barrymore silent "
noreview,"after the discussion of the newly-restored version of frank capra's lost horizon , where several scenes had been restored using stills , i was interested to see sadie thompson , where the last 5 minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago . "
noreview,"this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story "" miss thompson "" . "
noreview,"this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen--little awkwardness , and a very clever script . "
noreview,"the actors : gloria swanson , raoul walsh ( who also directed and wrote the screenplay ) and especially lionel barrymore , as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie's soul , but really wants to get her between the sheets , is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel . "
noreview,"swanson adds real life to the character , adding an worldly , affectionate air to the bawdy sadie . "
noreview,"unfortunately , the ending is rather poorly tied up ; it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live-action film , or the original script . "
noreview,the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on ( i cannot believe maugham's short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia ) ; the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we've been waiting an hour and a half for . 
noreview,"still , it's entertaining right up to the end ; certainly barrymore's incredibly hammy performance ( which , nonetheless , works , perhaps due to the silent screen ) is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells , bakkers , and robertses of the religious worlds . "
noreview,a c movie ; worth 2 . 50 if you can find it . 
noreview,"the pied piper ( czechoslovakia , 1986 ) director : jim barta screenwriter : kamil piza "
noreview,this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids . 
noreview,"it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate , and with a lot of political comment along with it . "
noreview,perhaps economic content is a better word--it certainly doesn't show capitalism in a good light . 
noreview,"nor human nature , nor anything else , for that matter . "
noreview,"as you may have guessed , this is not a tgif film ; this is the kind of film you are glad is over . "
noreview,not that it wasn't interesting for technical reasons ; this is stop-animation that is very well done . 
noreview,all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts--except for the animated stuffed rats . 
noreview,"boy , sounds like a real comedy vehicle , doesn't it ? "
noreview,"add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison , and you have something to give the wee ones ( and some of the mentally unstable larger folk ) to keep them up at night . "
noreview,some gore . 
noreview,don't bring children to this one . 
noreview,"don't bring adults to this one , unless they're fascinated by puppetry and/or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped . "
noreview,blech . 
noreview, . no fun whatsoever . 
noreview,"meier ( west germany , 1986 ) director/screenwriter : peter timm cast : rainier grenkowitz , nadja engelbrecht , alexander hauff , thomas besvater sub-titled "
noreview,"this film takes us back and forth over the east german/west german border with meier , an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money . "
noreview,"his uncle ( also in the west ) sneaks meier out of the country , unknown to the east germans . "
noreview,"meier , however , is less than thrilled-- his girlfriend , his friends and his job ( which he likes ) all exist in east germany . "
noreview,"after a round-the-world trip ( his boss think's he's on leave in bulgaria ) , meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id , and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew's work--while everyone think's he's still living in east germany . "
noreview,"of course , something goes wrong--and the ending is very funny , but it takes the film too long to get there . "
noreview,"the humor is spread too thin , and much of the plot is too obvious ( as is the acting ) . "
noreview,"still , a good concept for the comedy , and the last five minutes are pretty funny . "
noreview,c -- $2 . 50 . 
noreview,"the right hand man ( australia , 1986 ) director : di drew screenplay : helen hodgman cast : rupert everett , hugo weaving , arthur dignam , jennifer claire , catherine mcclements "
noreview,"after a lifetime of movie-going , and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival , i've learned several rules which , while not absolute , should certainly be given deference to : "
noreview,1 ) be wary of french comedies . 
noreview,these people like jerry lewis . 
noreview,"2 ) ken russell is never going to grow up , no matter how long you wait . "
noreview,"3 ) any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as "" old pouty-lips "" is probably not worth watching . "
noreview,"4 ) when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography , watch out ! "
noreview,"australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo , but since weir and miller left for foreign shores , finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult ( not impossible--witness malcolm last year ) task . "
noreview,"well , i ignored rules 3 & 4 last night , and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards . "
noreview,"it's as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30's about tragedy among the gentry , and falling in love with people below your station , and horses . "
noreview,lots and lots of horses . 
noreview,"the film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship , which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing , because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir . "
noreview,"unfortunately , said son , a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times , kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident . "
noreview,"highlights include the amputation sequence ; the doctor's daughter , who has the hots for the son , tasting his urine for a diagnosis ; their tender kissing with a window between them ( while it's raining--you'd think a woman studying medicine would know better ) . "
noreview,"the photography is good , but i kept wishing for b&w--everything seems sepia-colored anyway . "
noreview,"actually , i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead , but that's life . "
noreview,"grade : z . avoid like the plague , unless you're looking for inadvertent yuks . "
noreview,"capsule : the weakest and least engaging of the alien movies , dragged down by an uninvolving story and no real tension . "
noreview,"alien 3 ( the "" 3 "" should be in superscript ) is a sad and wan entry in what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen . "
noreview,"it continues the story of ripley , the space-trucker-turned-impromptu-survivalist , but seems remarkably uninterested in her . "
noreview,"in fact , the movie seems lucky to be interested in anything at all , it's so elegaic and limp . "
noreview,"a little of this would have been nice for atmosphere , but the movie telegraphs its own tragedy from the beginning . "
noreview,"at the end of the last film ( aliens ) , ripley and two survivors were on their way home . "
noreview,"unfortunately , an alien pod had been deposited in their ship , and wound up triggering off their ejection in an escape pod . "
noreview,"the pod crashes on firorina 161 , a prison planet designed to house the incurably criminally violent . "
noreview,ripley lives through the crash ; the others do not . 
noreview,"the prison is a grim place , even as prisons go -- it's been built around the remnants of an abandoned steelworks , which provides no end of techno-gothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against . "
noreview,"lice are endemic , and so ripley's head is shaved ( another surreal touch ) . "
noreview,"at first it looks like she just has to hold out as an unwelcome guest until a company rescue ship can arrive , but it doesn't stay that way . "
noreview,"one of the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches , and soon a newly-gestated alien is running amuck . "
noreview,"worse , it looks like ripley herself has been impregnated . "
noreview,"what's weird is how little tension this generates , except near the end , when the pressure is being troweled on through every cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable : loud music , shaky camerawork , etc . sigourney weaver has become comfortable with the role , and she does well with it , but this time the role has been underwritten and left slack . "
noreview,"the supporting actors are also not given a lot to do : the doctor ( charles dance ) and another , rather religious inmate ( charles s . dutton , very good ) , hiave presence , but they're not asked to do anything with it . "
noreview,"in light of the impending sequel , which apparently plays fast and loose with the ending of this movie , i will not talk about the ending -- except to say that they found a remarkably good ending for such a drab movie . "
noreview,it's strange that some of the desperate and improvisational thinking that they found to wind up this story couldn't have driven the rest of it . 
noreview,"numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci-fi , suspense thrillers . "
noreview,"soldier is a multi ? crossbreed between the likes of terminator , aliens and offspring . "
noreview,the problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel ? not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground . 
noreview,"besides this , the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age . "
noreview,"the fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured , slow and sluggish , and could have done with better choreography . "
noreview,"russell who is usually a good actor in b-grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character ? sergeant todd , who seems more like a sergeant toad . "
noreview,"besides having almost no dialogue , his character appears stunted , zombie-like which is in line with his screen persona , but scores little points of empathy with the audience . "
noreview,"this movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson , whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth . "
noreview,"although this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former , it is still a long way from anything considered desirable . "
noreview,"a documentary from the twin hughes brothers , allen and albert ( dead presidents , menace ii society ) , about street pimps , all of whom are african-american . "
noreview,an offscreen interviewer questions them about their lives and profession . 
noreview,"it is mostly the pimps who do the talking for their ho's , and the egotistical and flamboyant way you would expect them to be , is what you get . "
noreview,"i learned that the word "" bitch "" is their favorite word , as it seemed to crop up in every sentence they used . "
noreview,"it makes for a film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say , but if one has a sense a humor for what their lifestyle is about , then some of what they rap about might seem amusing . "
noreview,"they seem to all want to be thought of as businessmen , in the business because it is the easiest way for them to make big money . "
noreview,"it's also a power trip , accomplished by manipulating the girls to work for them , mostly by humiliating them and keeping them in place . "
noreview,"this sleazy pic , soon became grating and wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears . "
noreview,these verbose pimps had a smart answer for everything and never knew when to shut their face . 
noreview,"the hughes brothers used as their pimp role models , the feather-hatted , fur-coated , diamond ring-wearing , gold chain wearing , flashy cadillac-cruising pimp of the late '70s blaxploitation movies--like the mack and willie dynamite . "
noreview,"also used as reference , was iceberg slim's best-seller pimp , the story of my life . "
noreview,"we meet pimps such as : fillmore slim , c-note , charm , k-red , gorgeous dre , bishop don magic juan , and rosebudd . "
noreview,"they readily discuss their business arrangements : including percentages , lifestyles , knockin ( stealing another pimp's ho ) , and the thrill they get from women giving them money . "
noreview,"these dudes needed no prompting to talk , as they just love to brag about about themselves . "
noreview,"gord brody ( tom green ) is an aspiring animator approaching thirty who still lives in parents jim ( rip torn ) and julie's ( julie hagerty , "" airplane "" ) basement . "
noreview,"as dad declares all out war , gord secures a job in a cheese sandwich factory in far off la and sets off to make his dreams come true . "
noreview,"gord doesn't make much of a go on his first attempt and lands back home with fawning mom and outraged dad in "" freddy got fingered . "" "
noreview,"tom green cowrites ( with "" tom green show "" scribe derek harvie ) , directs and stars in what is essentially tom green's primal scream . "
noreview,"so , if tom green screams in an empty theater , does he make a sound ? "
noreview,"it's clear that "" freddy got fingered "" is at least partially autobiographical and green sure has one hell of a complex about his dad ( mom gets off easier when sonny boy advises her to go out and have sex with basketball players and greeks ) . "
noreview,"while this may be of interest to his hard core fans , there's little about green's mania on display here to recommend this movie to anyone else . "
noreview,"the film starts promisingly enough , with a well executed skateboarding scene through a shopping mall set to the sex pistols' 'problem' ( green's put together a first rate soundtrack ) and yes , i laughed a few times . "
noreview,"green's flummoxing of a security guard with psychotic ramblings and his attempt to draw , make music and eat at the same time ( the 'daddy would you like some sausages' scene repeatedly shown in the film's trailer ) are inspired comedy . "
noreview,but what's funny about a paraplegic girlfriend who gets turned on by having her legs caned or a skateboarding injury that results in an exposed kneecap ? 
noreview,a baby delivery bit shows some groan-inducing promise until enough blood is splattered to coagulate the laughs . 
noreview,"younger ( by three years ) brother freddy's internment at the institute for sexually abused children does nothing but confirm one's worst fears regarding the film's title and green's infamous 'handling' of a real horse , while not nearly as shocking as it would seem , doesn't make sense . "
noreview,"by the time he repeats the gag with an elephant at film's end , the overall effect is numbness . "
noreview,"while "" freddy got fingered "" has the admirable end result of depicting the harm in demeaning a child's self esteem , it's essentially a whole lot of tom green running around being noisy . "
noreview,"rip torn , what were you thinking ? "
noreview,various films seen at the seattle film festival : 
noreview,much ado about nothing . 
noreview,"ah , how sweet the irony ! "
noreview,"it's accepted wisdom in some circles - among english literature nuts , mainly - that whenever a critic knocks shakespeare they are only doing so through ignorance . "
noreview,"he just doesn't "" understand "" shakespeare , you will hear them say . "
noreview,the bard's work is apparently beyond criticism . 
noreview,what a load of old cobblers . 
noreview,"if these arbiters of public taste think kenneth branaugh's film of shakespeare's "" comedy "" much ado about nothing is comedy in any modern sense of the word , it's time to get a life . "
noreview,get monty python . 
noreview,get woody allen . 
noreview,get john waters . 
noreview,whatever . 
noreview,"just get a real taste of some clever , witty , risky comedy . "
noreview,and banish this nonsense to where it belongs . 
noreview,drama and tragedy was shakespeare's strength . 
noreview,to my sensibilities - and i'm no stick in the mud - much ado about nothing resonates with no spark whatsoever . 
noreview,no kidding : this film ranks among the most embarrassing two hours i have ever spent in a cinema in my 20 years of movie going . 
noreview,"the only thing that stopped me walking out was loyalty to my lady friend , as this was our day out and i hadn't seen her in ages . "
noreview,"but boy , does she owe me one ! "
noreview,i won't spend too much time on the plot . 
noreview,"basically , we follow the trials and tribulations of two would-be couples - one young , the other older . "
noreview,"there's some dark treachery amongst all this , but everyone is so awfully jolly that you'd hardly know it . "
noreview,"mind you , there's nothing wrong with the basic story . "
noreview,good romantic comedies based on similar premises abound . 
noreview,"nothing wrong with most of the cast , either . "
noreview,"branaugh , emma thompson and denzel washington are all talented performers . "
noreview,"the problem is the script , or more accurately , shakespeare's original text . "
noreview,light comedy shouldn't be complex . 
noreview,"yet wrapped in elizabethan english , the dialogue becomes difficult to comprehend . "
noreview,"for this alone it will be a problem for modern audiences unschooled in shakespeare and in search of nothing more than a good , undemanding laugh . "
noreview,"the only laughs to escape my belly were brought on by the gloriously inept performance of keanu reeves , the actor once again miscast as a jealous half-brother or something . "
noreview,"but when dissected and understood , what it all boils down to is that this stuff is just so goddamn lame . "
noreview,this is comedy so clean and nice and corny and so devoid of danger that it leaves this viewer totally cold . 
noreview,"ho , ho , ho , boy likes girl ! "
noreview,"ho , ho , ho , men are such klutzes ! "
noreview,"ho , ho , ho , she's so awfully clumsy ! "
noreview,oh please ! 
noreview,"there's wit in here somewhere , i'm told . "
noreview,i call it pretentious . 
noreview,something lightweight striving to be something sophisticated through clever wordplay . 
noreview,"in the end , it's cringeworthy . "
noreview,watching some of the cinema patrons around me collapse with laughter made much ado about nothing a very weird movie going experience . 
noreview,comedy ? 
noreview,"bah , humbug ! "
noreview,"another formula 'feel good' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like "" waking ned devine , "" and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line . "
noreview,"it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin . "
noreview,"the strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol . "
noreview,"the film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas . "
noreview,"but its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message . "
noreview,its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the 'war on drugs' is about to be escalated into colombia . 
noreview,"the drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future , it has so far just ended up causing america's jails to be overcrowded with non-violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america's drug usage and drug supply . "
noreview,"billions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war , by backing a corrupt government ( remember vietnam ! ) with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country . "
noreview,"everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war . "
noreview,"the film's mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never . "
noreview,"there has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether . "
noreview,"the film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle-aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide . "
noreview,the widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined . 
noreview,"he left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage . "
noreview,the widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband's enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless . 
noreview,"she also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick ) . "
noreview,"what makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that when conferring with honey , she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her . "
noreview,"even though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can , the creditors swoop down on her like vultures . "
noreview,"her gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing . "
noreview,"since she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use . "
noreview,"the two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity , as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high-quality stuff . "
noreview,"for grace , this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ; for the scotsman , matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky ( valerie ) . "
noreview,"the locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed : the police sergeant ( campbell ) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace's greenhouse is for , the friendly vicar ( phillips ) counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can't control , and the doctor ( clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation . "
noreview,"the story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big-time drug dealer instead of having matthew go , because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn't want matthew to end up in jail . "
noreview,"it is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail . "
noreview,"the scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole , whereby it never recovered its dignity . "
noreview,"the film moves into the formula mode , whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( tcheky karyo ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity . "
noreview,"things work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood . "
noreview,"there are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded . "
noreview,"this 'unhip' film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated as something naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute . "
noreview,ummm ! 
noreview,review
noreview,"maybe you're curious , the way you have to look in your hanky after you blow your nose . "
noreview,you just have to know how bad bad can be . 
noreview,"if that's the case , rejoice , because it was twenty years ago today ( or so ) that sgt . "
noreview,"pepper's lonely hearts club band was released ( unleashed ? ) to the world , and thanks to our modern technological advances , you can find this retched piece of filmmaking on vhs . "
noreview,"derived from the lyrics of various beatles' songs , sgt . "
noreview,"pepper's tells the story of the fictitious band made popular from the song ( and album ) of the same name , released in 1967 . "
noreview,"of course , the movie was made eleven years later , the gibbs three have become the lonely hearts , peter frampton is the one and only billy shears , and aside from being about a rock band , the story doesn't correlate to the song at all . "
noreview,"and oh , what joy - we're the lovely audience they'd like to take home with them . "
noreview,i don't think so . 
noreview,"but at least these characters are actually * people * in a beatles' song , whereas other characters such as strawberry fields ( sandy farina ) gets her name from a song about a * place * called strawberry fields . "
noreview,"the debate over this is really quite futile when it comes down to it , because all the film really has to offer is a feast of horrid cover tunes , embarrassing cameo appearances ( george burns ? ! "
noreview,steve martin ? ! ? 
noreview,"alice cooper ? ! ? ! ) , and uuuuuuggggggglllllllyyyyy 70's fashion and faces . "
noreview,check please ! 
noreview,the plot is a bit unclear . 
noreview,people with bad 70's hair run around in leisure suits engaging in music video sequences that look like a sick and twisted world of make-believe from an overly demented mr . rogers . 
noreview,"mean mr . mustard ( frankie howerd ) somehow gets hold of all billy & co . 's instruments , calling dr . maxwell edison ( steve martin with a silver hammer and an out-of-key singing voice ) , the sun king , marvin sunk ( alice cooper ! ) , and a couple of creepy robots to his aid . "
noreview,supposedly this is a horrible thing ? 
noreview,"i guess in heartland , the talent is pretty non-existent . "
noreview,"meanwhile , the lonely hearts are off doing the classic "" sex , drugs , and rock n' roll "" thing , leaving poor strawberry fields without her true love , billy . "
noreview,"she sets out to find him , leaving her poor dad and mom ( mrs . "
noreview,fields ! 
noreview,"hey , wanna cookie ? ) "
noreview,"all alone to sing a horrible rendition of "" she's leaving home "" , accompanied by those same creepy robots . "
noreview,but is billy getting it on with lucy ( dianne steinberg ) ? 
noreview,"ya know , the diamond possessing girl who hangs out in the sky ? "
noreview,"well , there's some crazy chick singing soprano on the roof of a building next to a bus stop , and i assume that's who it was . "
noreview,"it's movies like this that make ya sit back and ask the unanswerable question , "" what the hell were they thinking ? ? ? "" "
noreview,"nobody will ever know , but as a novelty , sgt . "
noreview,pepper's is one to examine . 
noreview,"carol channing , robert palmer , keith carradine - they're all here . "
noreview,but why ? ? ? ? 
noreview,who knows . 
noreview,it's irrelevant . 
noreview,"there's as much meaning to be found here as there is to be found in your belly-button lint , although the latter may be more interesting . "
noreview,"with the recent onslaught of 70's nostalgia in the movie world ( the ice storm , boogie nights , reissues of the star wars trilogy , etc . ) , let's pray this doesn't get a special 20th anniversary , second-chance in theaters . "
noreview,"in the words of paul mccartney , live and let die . "
noreview,"in fact , bury this one while you still can . "
noreview,warning : spoilers are included in this review . . . 
noreview,but it doesn't really make much of a difference . 
noreview,"deep impact begins the official summer movie season , and it also brings back memories of 1997 . "
noreview,remember when dante's peak came out in february ? 
noreview,"a few months later , volcano was released . "
noreview,"the first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen . "
noreview,the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent . 
noreview,"well , it's deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition . "
noreview,"this time , unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july . "
noreview,"of course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante's peak . "
noreview,"but while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film . "
noreview,"apparently many did , and it utterly baffles me . "
noreview,"to be completely honest , i haven't had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life . "
noreview,"volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch . "
noreview,"deep impact doesn't just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot . "
noreview,the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters . 
noreview,"deep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 ) . "
noreview,"a line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above . "
noreview,among these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) . 
noreview,"leo unknowingly discovers a comet , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds . "
noreview,"he races off to mail the information , but is killed in a reckless car accident . "
noreview,"a year passes , and nothing is heard about it again . "
noreview,"we are then introduced to jenny lerner ( t ? a leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc . "
noreview,she gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell ) . 
noreview,she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie . 
noreview,"after talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help . "
noreview,"luckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain "" ellie "" that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film . . . "
noreview,that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled ) . 
noreview,"before she can use the information , the government decides to push her car off the road . "
noreview,"they take her in to meet the president of the united states , president beck ( morgan freeman ) . "
noreview,beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference . 
noreview,"naturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question . "
noreview,"and so , yada yada yada , they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive . "
noreview,"they announce a plan called "" ark , "" which is their only hope for survival . "
noreview,"a computer will select 800 , 000 people at random . "
noreview,these people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won't kill off the entire human race . 
noreview,"after two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer--approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over . "
noreview,"the rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning . "
noreview,"jenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom . "
noreview,the final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional . 
noreview,it's a shame that nothing else is heartfelt . 
noreview,"now , of course , we all know that the comet does impact the surface . "
noreview,"the title alone suggests it , and the previews actually show it ! "
noreview,"by doing this , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won't work . "
noreview,"director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show "" er . "" "
noreview,"her major film debut was the peacemaker , a pathetic and heartless action film . "
noreview,"well , this time leder outdid herself , creating a film worse than that one . "
noreview,"suggestion to ms . leder : please , stay away from the big screen , or at least the action genre . "
noreview,"much of the blame can be placed on leder directly , because the pace is disastrously off . "
noreview,throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours ) . 
noreview,it literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real-time--it's that boring . 
noreview,"of course , leder isn't all to blame for it . "
noreview,screenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time . 
noreview,what starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway ) . 
noreview,"chock full of cheesy one liners ( "" you know , you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school ! "" ) "
noreview,"and stupid characters , you might think we were back in the 70s again . "
noreview,"only one of the subplots is remotely interesting , while the rest are forgettable and boring . "
noreview,"and the main plot is so outrageous that you can't figure out if this film is supposed to be an action , drama , or sci-fi . "
noreview,to put it simply : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation . 
noreview,"that's right , 80% miss , and 20% hit . "
noreview,"scenes above the earth are well done , and the orbiting ship is majestic . "
noreview,"but the comet is a huge mistake , making it more laughable than frightening . "
noreview,"the concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough , but that's forgiveable . "
noreview,what isn't forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface . 
noreview,"give me a break , will ya ? "
noreview,"and of course , the much hyped collision of comet and earth . "
noreview,"well , it is far from spectacular , and it makes independence day look brilliant . "
noreview,"the water rushing towards the land is effective , but once it hits the continent , the effects turn ridiculous . "
noreview,"cgi water is used , and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks . "
noreview,"in fact , i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days . "
noreview,"just when we think visual effects can't be improved , along comes a film to show that they really can and should be . "
noreview,"one thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder's direction , which also influences the actors . "
noreview,leder loves to show the actors' faces before and during moments of terror . 
noreview,"this reminded me of another action director , renny harlin ( die hard 2 , cliffhanger ) . "
noreview,but harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations . 
noreview,"leder likes to flaunt people's fears via their faces , but instead of coming off as sympathetic , leder seems more of a sadist . "
noreview,one moment has an astronaut flying off into space . 
noreview,"this should be enough to warrant a response from the audience , but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person's face while drifting into space . "
noreview,"this is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience , and i , for one , am not going to be fooled . "
noreview,"on another note , leder's film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts . "
noreview,"the pace does pick up , and some very emotional moments are shown . "
noreview,"then again , when you watch people cry for their loved ones , it's obvious it will be emotional . "
noreview,"it's mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into "" feeling "" for the characters , but it didn't work for me . "
noreview,"but anyway , the actors do as much as they can with what they are given . "
noreview,"t ? a leoni ( bad boys , tv's "" the naked truth "" ) is the best of the film , and she is given the meatiest role . "
noreview,"her character is made stronger by leoni's presence , and we grow to care for her . "
noreview,"robert duvall is energetic and fun to watch , but his character is turned into shreds by the plot . "
noreview,"elijah wood also comes off rather successfully , but he still hasn't had many good roles ( wood , stick to drama ! "
noreview,you are too talented for this stuff ) . 
noreview,"vanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable , and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen . "
noreview,"maximilian schell is distracting , but he does provide some nice humor . "
noreview,"morgan freeman has been infinitely better than this , and gives one of his most shallow performances to date ( which is quite remarkable for him ) . "
noreview,"leelee sobieski could have been better , but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character . "
noreview,a special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby . 
noreview,"eldard is good in his role , but is limited by the plot . "
noreview,"crosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv's "" star trek : the next generation . "" "
noreview,seeing her was one of the highlights of the film . 
noreview,"overall , a very talented cast virtually wasted . "
noreview,deep impact is rated pg-13 for disaster related elements and brief language . 
noreview,"this is one of the worst films of the year , and if it is any omen of things to come , this summer could be one of the worst ever . "
noreview,"luckily , the x-files movie is coming up , and hopefully armageddon will be more successful . "
noreview,it's a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn't worth much . 
noreview,"costing nearly $75 million , with special effects done by the illustrious ilm ( which is a huge shocker ) , and with a score composed by oscar-winner james horner ( titanic ) , one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience . "
noreview,"well , it's not . "
noreview,"when the comet does hit the earth , you almost wish it could just take this film along with it . "
noreview,my first press screening of 1998 and already i've gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list . 
noreview,what an auspicious beginning ! 
noreview,welcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l . a . and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere . 
noreview,"firestorm , the directorial debut of dances with wolves's academy award winning cinematographer dean semler , is the first of the new year's crop of movies . "
noreview,"as our story opens , the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are "" smokejumpers . "" "
noreview,"we then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl , where one of the gung-ho guys is taking a romance quiz from "" cosmopolitan . "" "
noreview,"having the time of their lives , they then jump into the middle of a burning forest . "
noreview,"when , even in the beginning , the director can't get the small parts right , you can sense the movie is in trouble . "
noreview,"with the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline-filled cars , smokejumper monica ( christianne hirt ) tells them to get away from their soon-to-explode vehicles . "
noreview,"not bothering to shout nor even get close to them , she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people . "
noreview,"miraculously , they manage to hear her and move away . "
noreview,"in a movie that specializes in cheap shots , the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building . "
noreview,"as it does throughout , overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f . windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl's face . "
noreview,"our show's two heroes , the crew's chief , wynt perkins , played laconically by scott glenn , and his second-in-command , jesse graves , played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal , enter the burning house looking for the little girl . "
noreview,in a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames . 
noreview,the manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse . 
noreview,"this mawkish show cuts back to monica , who has a life-or-death decision to make . "
noreview,the chopper with the fire-retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group . 
noreview,will it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monica's two firefighting buddies ? 
noreview,she has only seconds to decide who will be saved . 
noreview,"yes , she goes for the majority , but , miracle of miracles , the other three come out alive anyway . "
noreview,"not content with a traditional firefighting story , chris soth's screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape . "
noreview," ( "" hoods in the woods , "" is what the "" ground-pounders "" yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire . ) "
noreview,"along the way , shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis , who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father , who was a marine drill instructor . "
noreview,most of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing . 
noreview,he flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck . 
noreview,arguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside . 
noreview,"using a ramp , he shoots straight out of the top of the building's attic , and when he hits the ground , he just rides off in a cloud of dust . "
noreview,"when the film isn't using some stock footage of actual forest fires , the simulated ones look hokey . "
noreview,editor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions . 
noreview,"the ending , with its sick twists , manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie . "
noreview,"perhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby , "" it's not as bad as some of the television sitcoms . "" "
noreview,firestorm runs mercifully just 1 : 29 . 
noreview,it is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers . 
noreview,"ever since wargames , the first real computer hacking movie , hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking . "
noreview,these films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous . 
noreview,"if it's not this , the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect . "
noreview,hackers is guilty of all of these crimes . 
noreview,"to anyone familiar with computers and/or the internet , most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you can't take it anymore . "
noreview,"those of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web , the internet movie database , are probably aware of the section for movies entitled "" goofs "" . "
noreview,this is the section for mistakes in the movies . 
noreview,"well , imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the first goof listed : "" generally ill-informed and ridiculous to the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers and technology "" . "
noreview,"and truthfully , this is one-hundred percent correct . "
noreview,"the plot , obviously , centers around computer hacking . "
noreview,"more specifically , it follows the exploits of dade murphy , a young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller . "
noreview,"miller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting , because if it were not for that , who knows where his career would be now after hackers . "
noreview,the film opens with a young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems . 
noreview,he was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen years old . 
noreview,"the film then picks up at that point , an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer . "
noreview,"dade later meets up with fellow hackers acid burn ( angelina jolie ) , cereal killer ( matthew lillard ) , lord nikon ( laurence mason ) , and the phantom phreak ( renoly santiago ) , who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible : hack the gibson computer and not get caught by the fbi . "
noreview,"oh , and as a little sub-plot , dade also tries to woo acid burn , the only female hacker in the film . "
noreview,"really , i can't think of much more to say about the film's plot aside from what i've said . "
noreview,"it's just a bunch of computer geeks ( no , obsessive compulsive computer geeks a little too advanced for reality ) running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi . "
noreview,"thanks to this movie , the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do . "
noreview,"this movie makes computers look a little bit too advanced for their time , and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many to list . "
noreview,"to sum it up , hackers is a terrible computer film . "
noreview,"if you're looking for a film about computers closer to what goes on in the real world , i suggest sneakers . "
noreview,"although at times it too may seem a little far fetched , it should be much more believable than hackers to regular computer users . "
noreview,"hopefully , this film didn't influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time . "
noreview,"if there's one thing i just can't stand , it's a film that oozes with sentimentality . "
noreview,here's a note to all film makers : films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves . 
noreview,"swelling , saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy , and that the situation is hopeless . "
noreview,"alas , my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up . "
noreview,"what reminded me was that i wasn't choked up , or even the slightest bit moved , for that matter . "
noreview,"my giant is a forced , contrived , and conspicuously un-cute ( i detest the word "" cute "" but i've chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a "" cute "" film here ) . "
noreview,"it takes a premise that might have been interesting ( i liked the preview ) , and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches , all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience . "
noreview,maybe it will work for some people . 
noreview,it didn't work for me . 
noreview,"billy crystal plays sam cayman , an agent who , at the beginning of the film , is in romania . "
noreview,he's in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film . 
noreview,"the screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired , get in a car accident , and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall . "
noreview,"his name is max ( gheorghe muresan ) , and sam thinks he'd be a great movie star because of his size . "
noreview,"subplots are as follows : sam has a son and a wife ( kathleen quinlan ) , and he's never around for them , so they move to chicago . "
noreview,max is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins . 
noreview,"sam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money , and so their various subplots can all be resolved . "
noreview,sam is broke . 
noreview,max is dying . 
noreview,pass the kleenex . 
noreview,"my giant , as a comedy , is only moderately funny . "
noreview,"it has its moments , the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself . "
noreview,"in one great scene , sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal ; of course , his son doesn't believe that he's actually speaking to seagal , and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is ( i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect ) . "
noreview,"crystal is always entertaining , and he has a few good lines here ( some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely ) ; often , however , he's countered by a slew of jokes that aren't funny , and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes . "
noreview,"muresan is kind of fun to watch , but he just can't act very well . "
noreview,"quinlan , on the other hand , is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents . "
noreview,"she was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown , but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff . "
noreview,"here , the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent . "
noreview,"all of these disappointing ingredients create a film that , for much of its running time , is simply mediocre . "
noreview,"as my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion , however , director michael lehmann ( who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk ) and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable , each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings . "
noreview,sam's multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed ( how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family ? ) . 
noreview,"later , it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sam's reunion with his family . "
noreview,"and some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is a valiant thing , but i had a few morality problems with it ( and i apologize for being vague ) . "
noreview,it's icky . 
noreview,"it drips with gooey , wannabe human emotions . "
noreview,my giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film . 
noreview,"more importantly , it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is . "
noreview,"instead , it's a complicated , overlong , and under-engaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears . "
noreview,"and since it left me feeling completely unmoved , i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world . "
noreview,this is not a simple plan about finding a plane load of money and getting away with the cash . 
noreview,"this is more about a parable of greed , and how money can become the bane of your life . "
noreview,"yes , there are elements of ? fargo' here ( the snow and cold ) , although not as vivid in the blood and gore department . "
noreview,it shows how greed can set of a chain of events leading to death and the destruction of lives . 
noreview,"and how at the end of the day , the things that matter most are love , truth and honesty . "
noreview,"although in one sense it may seem tedious , making a movie about the ugliness of greed ( not box office material ) , it does become tedious , not because of the morale ending , but because one expects the movie to end that way . "
noreview,"this becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the crime , the rest of the movie just spirals downward from there . "
noreview,"the characters in this drama are a mixture of simple and intellectual folk , brothers and friends , who all fall prey to the avarice of money . "
noreview,"they should have perhaps thrown in someone sensible , level headed and not affected by greed to give the party more balance . "
noreview,"commendable is the exceptional performance of billy bob thornton , whose portrayal of the simpleton brother was masterful . "
noreview,"bill paxton also gives a powerful performance as the greedier younger brother , whilst bridget fonda is convincing as the greediest wife , who indirectly causes the most problems . "
noreview,"fill a room full of greedy people and several million dollars , and you will end up with a simple recipe for a blood bath . "
noreview,"it's not a simple plan , when you shoot everyone you love for money , unless you're the menendez brothers . "
noreview,"based on the 1960s tv series that i had never seen or heard of before this movie ( be happy , i won't bore you with any lame and unnecessary comparisons ) , this film allows will smith to take a third stab at the independence day weekend box-office , after scoring huge successes with men in black ( 7/10 ) , directed by the same man who controlled this one , and independence day ( 6/10 ) . "
noreview,can you say . . . the 
noreview,third times not a charm ? 
noreview,"plot : james west and artemus gordon are chosen by the president to find the man responsible for the kidnapping of the nation's top scientists , and threatening to take over the united states within a week . "
noreview,critique : i did not laugh once during this entire picture . 
noreview,"when you consider that this film is a part-comedy , that's not a very good sign . "
noreview,i also did not tense up or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic action sequences which provided me with little more than a few minutes time to think back to the lovely salma hayek scenes . 
noreview,"when you consider that the other "" part "" of this film is geared as an action/adventure , i would say that this another negative sign . "
noreview,"and when you consider that the first hour of the film was boring and a little slow , the story-line tired , reminiscent of swiss cheese and uninvolving , and the special effects interesting but worth very little inside a plot filled with lame one-liners , weak characterizations and an anti-climactic end , you pretty much have the gist of my impression of this "" big "" summer blockbuster . "
noreview,it blows . 
noreview,"or as they say in french , "" eet blows "" . "
noreview,could it be that the script was crappy because it took four people to write it ? 
noreview,maybe . 
noreview,"could it be that most of the special effects don't show up until the last half hour , and even then , we don't see anything that its trailers hadn't already given away ? "
noreview,perhaps . 
noreview,"or could it be that we have come to expect so much more from will smith and hollywood big-budget movies , that we cannot help but evaluate them on a scale onto their own ? "
noreview,naaaaaaah ! 
noreview,a bad movie is a bad movie . 
noreview,"on a positive note , i could honestly say that i did very much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek , who seemed underused ( in my humble opinion ) , and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in . "
noreview,"branagh was also fun as the scenery-munching , over-the-top bad guy , but that's pretty much where the entertainment-buck stopped . "
noreview,"smith and kline were static at best , the plot full of holes , and the score insignificant and derivative of a dozen others . "
noreview,i would strongly advise anyone not to see this movie . 
noreview,"then again , there is that one scene with the lovely salma hayek tied up in a cage . . . huh . . . oh "
noreview,"yeah , but the rest of the movie sucked . "
noreview,"little known facts about this film and its stars : will smith has starred in two of the ten all-time top grossing films worldwide : 1997's summer blockbuster men in black ( 7/10 ) , for which he also recorded the grammy-winning title song , and 1996's independence day ( 6/10 ) . "
noreview,he once turned down a scholarship to mit to pursue his singing career . 
noreview,"kevin kline is a graduate of the juilliard school of drama , and has been married to the cute-as-a-button actress phoebe cates since 1989 . "
noreview,"they have two kids together , greta simone and owen . "
noreview,"one of the buildings that gets blown up in this film has "" kasdan "" written on it . "
noreview,"lawrence kasdan is a director known to have worked with kevin on five of his movies , including the big chill , silverado , i love you to death , grand canyon and french kiss . "
noreview,"salma hayek gave up a successful career as a major television star in latin america and moved to the united states to start over , even though she spoke no english . "
noreview,"she made her feature film debut as an actress with a small role in allison anders' mi vida loca ( no , not the rickie martin video ! ) and played her first starring role in robert rodriguez's desperado opposite antonio banderas . "
noreview,"since then , she has made an appearance in each one of rodriguez's films . "
noreview,"she stands 5'2 "" , was born in southeast mexico , and the daughter of a lebanese father and a mexican mother . "
noreview,"one of the actresses cast as branagh's lovely but lethal beauties includes bail ling , a stage and screen star in her native china who was last seen starring opposite dick gere in red corner ( 7/10 ) . "
noreview,"another is dutch-born frederique van der wal , who is one of the world's most recognized supermodels , having graced the cover of cosmopolitan numerous times , as well as harper's bazaar , vogue and mademoiselle . "
noreview,in the line of duty is the critically praised series of television movies dealing with the real-life incidents that claimed lives of law enforcement officers in usa . 
noreview,"the twilight murders , another one from the series , is dealing with the case of gordon kahl ( played by rod steiger ) , old farmer from north dakota who would rather spend a year in prison than pay taxes to the despised u . s . government . "
noreview,"after being released , he still refuses to pay taxes and the warrant is issued for his arrest . "
noreview,"when the u . s . marshals come to arrest him , it turns out that kahl isn't alone . "
noreview,"many poor farmers in rural northwest share his extremist anti-government beliefs , and the routine operation turns into shootout that would leave federal officers that . "
noreview,"that brings fbi on the scene , and agent mayberly ( michael gross ) is supervising the manhunt . "
noreview,"however , his efforts seem fruitless , since kahl still has many supporters , some of them even in the local law enforcement . "
noreview,"after betrayed , 1988 thriller by costa gavras , hollywood mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising right-wing extremism in the american northwest , and that remained so until oklahoma city bombing , when media hype brought right-wingers back into spotlight . "
noreview,"until that time , only the television movies like this one bothered to pay attention to that phenomenon . "
noreview,"unfortunately , the twilight murders is still routine and formulaic television film , that uses sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of originality in the script . "
noreview,"sometimes , like many american tv movies , it creates drama where drama shouldn't be . "
noreview,"on the other hand , film is steadily directed by dick lowry , and rod steiger does good job potraying gordon kahl . "
noreview,"on the other hand , michael gross as his pursuer is quite wooden and his interaction with some of the actors is terrible . "
noreview,"however , film does deal with potentially thought-provoking social and political issues , so hour and half spent in front of the screen shouldn't be the total waste of time . "
noreview,"nearly every film tim burton has directed has been an homage to the horror genre -- "" frankenweenie , "" "" beetlejuice , "" "" batman , "" "" edward scissorhands , "" "" ed wood , "" "" mars attacks ! "" "
noreview,-- yet none of them have been horror films . 
noreview," sleepy hollow "" is his first attempt to actually scare people . i greeted the prospect with high anticipation ; burton's whole career seemed to be leading up to this . i left disappointed . andrew kevin walker's screenplay takes only the character names from the classic short story "" the legend of sleepy hollow .  "
noreview,in the movie ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is a new york city police constable who is trying to introduce scientific methods of investigation to his superiors . 
noreview,ichabod is dispatched to the small town of sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders . 
noreview,several of the town's leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman . 
noreview,"although he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him , ichabod finds that the facts of the case confound his scientific reasoning . "
noreview,"he also discovers that the killings are not random , that the victims are tied together by a secret . "
noreview,along the way ichabod gets help from a bewitching ( literally ) young woman ( christina ricci ) and the son of one of the murder victims ( marc pickering ) . 
noreview,my reaction : ho-hum . 
noreview,the plot is an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality to make it interesting . 
noreview,that in itself is forgivable ; hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in new packages . 
noreview,"however , burton's attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy . "
noreview,"it might be his background -- in his previous movies , goofy was the goal . "
noreview,"along the same lines , it doesn't help that creature designer ( and producer ) kevin yagher has done his best work for the tongue-in-cheek tales from the crypt tv series . "
noreview,"a witch's eyes and tongue shoot out like roger rabbit's , a tree spurts blood like it's in a monty python sketch , and the headless horseman . "
noreview,"well , he's a guy without a head . "
noreview,on a horse ( boo ! ) . 
noreview,the performances are also awful . 
noreview,"although he's impressed me with his work in other films , depp doesn't seem to know what to do with ichabod , and his dialogue is hampered by stilted diction that's supposed to pass for an 18th century accent . "
noreview,"ricci seems to put all her effort into seeming enigmatic , which guarantees that we won't sympathize with her character . "
noreview,the actor who is revealed at the end to be the villain comes off as ridiculously cartoonish . 
noreview,"the only pleasure generated by the cast comes from surprise cameos by christopher lee , martin landau , and christopher walken . "
noreview,"i wonder if this movie was originally conceived as part of francis ford coppola's projected series of gothic adaptations , a series that produced only "" bram stoker's dracula "" and "" mary shelley's frankenstein . "" "
noreview,"coppola is an executive producer for "" sleepy hollow , "" and the script reflects his interest in early forms of "" moving pictures , "" particularly in a toy that ichabod carries which blends two pictures to create an optical illusion . "
noreview," ( there's a bird on one side of the card , a cage on the other . "
noreview,"when the card is flipped rapidly , the bird appears to be caged . ) "
noreview,bottom line : the hollow isn't the only thing that's sleepy . 
noreview,"every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio , with every indication that it will be a stinker , and to everybody's surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling . "
noreview,"mtv films' _election , a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon , is a current example . "
noreview,did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ? 
noreview,the plot is deceptively simple . 
noreview,george washington carver high school is having student elections . 
noreview,"tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over-achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high . "
noreview,"mr . "" m "" ( matthew broderick ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages paul , a popular-but-slow jock to run . "
noreview,"and paul's nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons . "
noreview,"the dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be . "
noreview,"you can't help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews , which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have . "
noreview,"_election , a good film , does not live up to its hype . "
noreview,"what makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ , released a few months earlier . "
noreview,the similarities are staggering : 
noreview,"tracy flick ( _election_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . "
noreview,"max fischer ( _rushmore_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . "
noreview,the most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . 
noreview,the most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . 
noreview,"tracy flick is from a single parent home , which has contributed to her drive . "
noreview,"max fischer is from a single parent home , which has contributed to his drive . "
noreview,"the male bumbling adult in _election_ ( matthew broderick ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . "
noreview,he even gets a bee sting . 
noreview,"the male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ ( bill murray ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . "
noreview,he gets several bee stings . 
noreview,and so on . 
noreview,what happened ? 
noreview,"how is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn't been fully formed yet ? "
noreview,"even so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul's anti-social sister , tammy . "
noreview,"broderick here is playing the mr . rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , and he seems to be having the most fun he's had since then . "
noreview,witherspoon is a revelation . 
noreview,"it's early in the year , it's a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination . "
noreview,"and once campbell's character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you're won over . "
noreview,one thing that's been bothering me since i've seen it . 
noreview,there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film . 
noreview,"i suppose that , coming from mtv films , i should expect no less . . . "
noreview,"but the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom . "
noreview,"as the screws tighten , and the tensions mount , alexander payne decides to add elements that , frankly , distract from the story . "
noreview,"it is bad enough that mr . m doesn't like tracy's determination to win at all costs , but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship ? "
noreview,"even so , there's no logical reason why mr . m has an affair when he does . "
noreview,"there's a lot to like in _election_ , but the plot similarities to _rushmore_ , and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex-driven , mark this as a disappointment . "
noreview,you've got mail works alot better than it deserves to . 
noreview,"in order to make the film a success , all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars , have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits . "
noreview,"no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it's body ( it's basically a complete re-shoot of the shop around the corner , only adding a few modern twists ) . "
noreview,"essentially , it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking . "
noreview,"it's overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy , not to mention very manipulative . "
noreview,"but oh , how enjoyable that manipulation is . "
noreview,"but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does , because i absolutely hated the previous ryan/hanks teaming , sleepless in seattle . "
noreview,"it couldn't have been the directing , because both films were helmed by the same woman . "
noreview,"i haven't quite yet figured out what i liked so much about you've got mail , but then again , is that really important ? "
noreview,"if you like something so much , why even question it ? "
noreview,"again , the storyline is as cliched as they come . "
noreview,"tom hanks plays joe fox , the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley , the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family-run children's book shop called , in a nice homage , the shop around the corner . "
noreview,fox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business . 
noreview,"little do they know , they are already in love with each other over the internet , only neither party knows the other person's true identity . "
noreview,the rest of the story isn't important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen . 
noreview,"sure , there are some mildly interesting subplots , but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship . "
noreview,"all of this , of course , leads up to the predictable climax . "
noreview,"but as foreseeable as the ending is , it's so damn cute and well-done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does . "
noreview,"when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love , i was filled with such , for lack of a better word , happiness that for the first time all year , i actually left the theater smiling . "
noreview,moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post-salary cap era -- you've got to know how to allocate your resources . 
noreview,every dollar spent on a free-agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers . 
noreview,"in the nfl , this leads to teams like the detroit lions , who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract , but can only field five guys named herb to block for him . "
noreview,"in the movies , you end up with films like "" spawn "" , with a huge special-effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors . "
noreview,jackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking . 
noreview,he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line . 
noreview,"watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid , fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars , is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit , except that sanders doesn't have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages . "
noreview,"but like the lions star , jackie doesn't have anybody to block for him . "
noreview,"almost every cent that's invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts , and as chan does his own stunts , the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills . "
noreview,"this leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors ( chan directs ) , scripts and dubbing and supporting characters , not to mention the hideous title sequence . "
noreview,this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain . 
noreview," ( chan's first release in this country , "" rumble in the bronx "" , was supposedly set in new york , but was filmed in vancouver , and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible . ) "
noreview,"heck , jackie doesn't even have enough money for a haircut , looks like , much less a personal hairstylist . "
noreview,"in condor , chan plays the same character he's always played , himself , a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen , a master of both kung-fu and slapstick-fu . "
noreview,"jackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert , and is chased by a horde of neo-nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs ( one of the things i like about jackie chan movies : no political correctness ) . "
noreview,"he is joined by three women , who have little to do except scream , "" jackie , save us ! "" , and misuse firearms . "
noreview,"the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere , and he's more pathetic than evil . "
noreview,"en route , we have an extended motorcycle chase scene , a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo-nazis , and two confrontations with savage natives . "
noreview,"once at the secret desert base , there is a long chop-socky sequence , followed by the film's centerpiece , a wind-tunnel fight that's even better than the one in face/off . "
noreview,"this is where the money was spent , on well-choreographed kung-fu sequences , on giant kevlar hamster balls , on smashed-up crates of bananas , and on scorpions . "
noreview,"ignore the gaping holes in the plot ( how , exactly , if the villain's legs were broken , did he escape from the secret nazi base , and why didn't he take the key with him ? ) . "
noreview,"don't worry about the production values , or what , exactly , the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara . "
noreview,just go see the movie . 
noreview,"operation condor has pretentions of being a "" raiders of the lost ark "" knockoff , but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him -- with a lawrence kazdan screenplay , a john williams score , spielberg directing and george lucas producing , condor might be an a+ movie . "
noreview,"however , you've got to go with what you've got , and what you've got in jackie chan is something special -- a talent that mainstream hollywood should , could , and ought to utilize . "
noreview,"on june 30 , 1960 , a self-taught , idealistic , yet pragmatic , young man became , at age 36 , the first head of government of a newly independent african state , formerly the belgian congo . "
noreview,"two months later , he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides . "
noreview,"this little-known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in "" lumumba . "" "
noreview,"patrice lumumba's ( eriq ebouaney ) story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary , "" lumumba - death of a prophet , "" virtually guaranteeing that his new , fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject . "
noreview,"peck , with co-writer pascal bonitzer , begins at the end of the story of the young political leader . "
noreview,we watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men . 
noreview,"images of hatchets , saws and fast-emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image . "
noreview,jump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian-owned congo . 
noreview,"a third class postal worker , lumumba , speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes , proclaiming himself not tribal , not regional , but a national leader . "
noreview,"his small , mobile party , the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer , and get his face known , in the bustling capital , stanleyville . "
noreview,"at a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world , lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc . "
noreview,"as the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation's first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) . "
noreview,"the coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country's vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more . "
noreview,"lumumba won't seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government . "
noreview,his initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination . 
noreview,"the situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , belgian troops violently intervene , the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad . "
noreview,this tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries . 
noreview,"peck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba , his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50's and 60's . "
noreview," ( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them . "
noreview,some colonial masters were better than others . ) 
noreview,"the effort involved in "" lumumba "" is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all . "
noreview,"production values are first rate on what must be a small , by us standards , budget . "
noreview,the period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique . 
noreview,the screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman's work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba's life . 
noreview,"the political side of things is evenly told in a linear , straightforward manner that teaches , not preaches . "
noreview,"it concentrates on the good deeds of the man , if a bit as a stalwart saint , but doesn't embellish on a larger than life persona . "
noreview,"the family side of patrice's life is handled in several , perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children , embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child . "
noreview,"i know the intent is to flesh the man out , but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba . "
noreview,"the story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it . "
noreview,high marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character . 
noreview,"the actor gives a convincing , charismatic performance as the multifaceted , politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions . "
noreview,"in true docudrama tradition , the supporting cast does not outshine the star , complementing his good efforts , instead . "
noreview," lumumba "" is a solid , interesting , educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos , both . it has more intelligence in its telling than anything i've seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b+ . "
noreview,"apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x . i don't know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether . "
noreview,"i've heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce . "
noreview,"as it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye's focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton . "
noreview,"it's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star . "
noreview,"norton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year . "
noreview,"he plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d'angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien ) . "
noreview,"the film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car . "
noreview,"we find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny . "
noreview,"in the present-time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother . "
noreview,"much of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek's adoption of white supremacy . "
noreview,"when derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things . "
noreview,"what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms . "
noreview,"it's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material . "
noreview,"because american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic . "
noreview,"i partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it's interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he's also very smart . "
noreview,the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men . 
noreview,"it's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs , and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up . "
noreview,"of course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part . "
noreview,it's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest . 
noreview,"in addition to getting the look just right , he's perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease . "
noreview,"even when he's at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead . "
noreview,what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny's school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny . 
noreview,"the other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d'angelo , and lien . "
noreview,"visually , the film is very powerful . "
noreview,"kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere . "
noreview,"but , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes . "
noreview,"although the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed . "
noreview,"for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way . "
noreview,"it makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film . "
noreview,perhaps this last scene was the problem . 
noreview,"it's hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak , american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way . "
noreview,one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy's wedding . 
noreview,and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it . 
noreview,"her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald , who hasn't made a worthwhile film since 1986 . "
noreview,"but the fact is , betsy's wedding is also an alan alda film . "
noreview,"and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years , alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life . "
noreview,"written and directed by alda , betsy's wedding is a vibrant slice-of-life , mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor . "
noreview,alda's comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare . 
noreview,"as bride and groom , molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film , but they are by far the least interesting . "
noreview,"walsh is a nonentity , with all the screen presence of a door knob . "
noreview,ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain . 
noreview,"she looks hideous with her short-cropped orange hair , red lip-stick and grotesque outfits . "
noreview,"she's supposed to be a dress designer , but she looks more like a clown . "
noreview,"and to make matters worse , ringwald's performance matches her appearance . "
noreview,"thankfully , alda keeps ringwald's screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters . "
noreview,"the wedding is just a device to bring together the bride's working-class , italian family and the groom's rich , gentile family . "
noreview,"ringwald's folks are homey and down-to-earth , with alda as her free-spirited father , madeline kahn as her practical mother , and ally sheedy as her lonely sister . "
noreview,"walsh's clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious . "
noreview,"when the two families meet and mingle , the movie becomes a story of culture clash , or as one character puts it , "" money versus values . "" "
noreview,"ally sheedy , in a wonderfully understated performance , is one of the film's most pleasant surprises . "
noreview,sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body . 
noreview,"it's anthony lapaglia , however , who seizes the spotlight . "
noreview,"lapaglia plays stevie dee , a suave , overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old-fashioned chivalry . "
noreview,lapaglia's sincere but dim-witted character is a riot . 
noreview,"and what's uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro , with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure . "
noreview,"lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting , and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role-model and partly a rip-off . "
noreview,"i don't know whether to say a star is born or a star is re-born , but i do know that lapaglia's over-the-top performance should not be missed . "
noreview,"the scrumptious comic acting , however , extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia . "
noreview,"joe pesci , in particular , sinks his teeth into his role as alda's unscrupulous brother-in-law , a slum lord with mob ties , who is cheating on his wife ( catherine o'hara ) . "
noreview,"alda , faced with challenge of both directing and acting , somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride's financially-strapped father , a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet . "
noreview,"the film adopts alda's psychological point of view as he tries to one : plan the wedding , and two : pay for it . "
noreview,"as a filmmaker , alda's style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful . "
noreview,"and while he doesn't have the comic genius of a woody allen , alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy . "
noreview,"after bloody clashes and independence won , lumumba refused to pander to the belgians , who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship with the congo . "
noreview,"their officers , particularly general janssens ( rudi delhem ) in the force publique , the congo's army , caused rebellions , undermining lumumba , who was outraged at the rape and murder of belgian nationals . "
noreview,"with unrest building , moise tshombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and the province of katanga , which contained 70 percent of the country's resources , proclaimed secession . "
noreview,"lumumba replaced janssens , making mobutu a colonel , and went on a pacification "
noreview,"tour with congolese president joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) , but it was too late . "
noreview,"'when you want to drown a dog , you say it has rabies , ' prophesies lumumba of his own fate . "
noreview,"peck and bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a myriad of players , although they frequently succumb to cliche , particularly regarding lumumba's private life . "
noreview,"peck's script illuminates bantu sayings like 'the hand that gives , rules' when lumumba uses it with the american ambassador . "
noreview,"peck's direction is less assured , with many scenes unfortunately playing like standard television fare . "
noreview,"he's served well , though , by his casting of ebouaney in the title role . "
noreview,"ebouaney is dynamic , radiating his character's fierce passion for his people and his country . "
noreview,"lumumba's intelligence and ability to strategize , even as he's cornered by insurmountable odds , are given life by ebouaney . "
noreview,peck's subject and lead actor elevate his film above its mediocre production . 
noreview,the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire-fu copycats . 
noreview,"it's not a pretty death , and it's leaving the likes of schwartznager , stallone , and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea . "
noreview,"sometimes , the mix results in a mind-blowing spectacle unlike any other . "
noreview,"quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work , as in 1999's the matrix , can be a real gem . "
noreview,"but too often hollywood gets it wrong , even when they pay off chinese directors . "
noreview,flying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists . 
noreview,mostly it's laughable . 
noreview,"in hollywood's rush to emulate the success of the matrix , trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form . "
noreview,"but iron monkey , the latest asian import , shows us how to get it right . "
noreview,"iron monkey ( actually a reissue of a 1993 film ) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante ( rongguang yu ) , fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry . "
noreview,"but it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei-hong , most recently seen in one of the most overlooked , and possibly best films of 2000 , drunken master 2 ( released in the u . s . as the legend of drunken master ) . "
noreview,"unlike drunken master 2 , which stars jackie chan as an adult fei-hong , iron monkey finds a much younger fei-hong ( sze-man tsang ) and his father wong kei-ying ( yen chi dan ) thrust into the middle of iron monkey's fight against oppression . "
noreview,"iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2 . at times , fighting styles , especially that of monkey himself , do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle-toed floating of films like crouching tiger , hidden dragon , director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth . "
noreview,"iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore , kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger . "
noreview,"however , there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters , such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good-hearted but misguided enemy , chief fox . "
noreview,"in those moments , and in others , iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience . "
noreview,"while in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2 , iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune . "
noreview,aka siunin wong fei-hung tsi titmalau . 
noreview,"after watching "" rat race "" last week , i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that , when not laughing aloud , i had held a grin for virtually all of the film's 112 minutes . "
noreview,"saturday night , i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didn't enjoy it as much the second time as the first . "
noreview," rat race "" is a great goofy delight , a dandy mix of energetic performances , inspired sight gags and flat-out silliness . hands down , this is the most fun film of the summer . the movie begins with zippy retro-style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a '60s slapstick comedy , featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky-jerky bodies bounding around the screen . then comes the setup . donald sinclair ( john cleese ) , the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas , enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients . to that end , he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines . gathering together the lucky token holders , he explains , "" today you have a chance to play a game where the odds of winning are one in six .  "
noreview,"the competition is simple : each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city , n . m . , containing $2 million in cash . "
noreview,"there is a transmitter in every key , so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead . "
noreview,the race has no rules ? whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money . 
noreview,"since it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes , let's use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers . "
noreview,"decked out in flashy , trashy clothing and sporting big hair , vera baker ( whoopi goldberg ) is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby . "
noreview,"she finds that grown-up merrill ( lanai chapman ) is erudite , conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life . "
noreview,"thrown together , it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature . "
noreview,owen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) is currently the most hated man in america . 
noreview,"an nfl referee , he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a high-profile game . "
noreview,"after escaping from a vengeful cab driver , owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention . "
noreview,"mr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) is a cheerful , odd little italian man on holiday in america . "
noreview,he also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most inopportune times . 
noreview,"pollini hitches a ride with zack ( wayne knight ) , a hyper-tense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation . "
noreview,randy pear ( jon lovitz ) promised his wife beverly ( kathy najimy ) and two kids a fun-filled vacation in las vegas . 
noreview,"fearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race , he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview . "
noreview,"beverly insists the family stay together , so they hop in the mini-van and tear off into the desert . "
noreview,"brothers duane ( seth green ) and blaine ( vince vieluf ) cody are young , crooked and stupid . "
noreview,"blaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly self-done tongue piercing , and duane is the only person who can come close to understanding him . "
noreview,the boys will stop at nothing to reach their goal . 
noreview,"finally , nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) is a no-nonsense lawyer-in-training who recruits helicopter pilot tracy faucet ( amy smart ) for the journey . "
noreview,"at first glance , they seem blandly wholesome , but all that changes when tracy buzzes the home of her boyfriend shawn ( dean cain ) and spies him swimming with another woman . "
noreview,"director jerry zucker ( "" airplane , "" "" ghost "" ) leaps from racer to racer , periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair and mr . grisham ( dave thomas ) , his personality-impaired right hand man , continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers . "
noreview,"as with any zucker production , a few jokes fall flat , but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps . "
noreview,"high points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally , with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay-off . "
noreview,"had i been part of the filmmaking team , i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby's clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron . "
noreview,it would have drawn the same laugh without the squirm-inducing hint of child molestation . 
noreview,i also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence . 
noreview,"my god , do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing "" all star ? "" "
noreview,but enough carping . 
noreview,i've noticed something lately that i've never thought of before . 
noreview,pseudo- substance - hollywood faking deep meanings in their films . 
noreview,"have you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed , then when you look back , you realize there was something missing ? "
noreview,"more and more , filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed , melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film , but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience , you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff . "
noreview,i'm not trying to say city of angels is that bad . 
noreview,"it had a lot going for it , but somewhere along the way , it faltered . "
noreview,"somehow , underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all , there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography . "
noreview,the predictable ending that shattered our hopes ( even though we saw it coming ) only added to the disappointment . 
noreview,"but for over an hour , city of angels is well worth the time . "
noreview,"nicolas cage is seth , a guardian angel who , like hundreds ( likely thousands or even millions ) of other angels , spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality ; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life . "
noreview,"meg ryan , in her most subdued performance yet , plays maggie , a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we're fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive . "
noreview,"after losing a patient on the surgery table , these questions envelope maggie , and seth , the angel who was there to oversee the patient's transition into the afterlife , is immediately captivated by the doctor . "
noreview,"he begins following and observing maggie , falling more and more in love with her everyday . "
noreview,"angels , who we quickly learn are not and never were humans , can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch , but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire . "
noreview,"seth's adoration is too much to resist , and eventually he does appear to maggie , quite regularly , although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community . "
noreview,"the angels are interestingly presented , all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities , but it's a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness . "
noreview,"cage is a wonderfully versatile actor ( think face/off , raising arizona , and it could happen to you - what a combo ! ) who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once . "
noreview,it's nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire . 
noreview,"the two aren't very comparable to each other , but they both deviate from her usual "" intelligently ditzy "" romantic comedy roles , and it's an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy . "
noreview,"but even though the two leads do an impressive job , it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye . "
noreview,"it's a shame that with so much going for it , city of angels falters so much in its final stages , leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there , they just didn't know quite how to get to it . "
noreview,they struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high . 
noreview,"filmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on , remember , and convey to others thru word of mouth , so after telling us for 60+ minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece , they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths . "
noreview,"based on the german film wings of desire ( that being the english title , of course ) , city of angels is ninety percent success , enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings , even the devastatingly disappointing ending . "
noreview,"most movie goers , the non-cynics anyway , will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized . "
noreview,"nonetheless , city of angels is beautifully captivating , which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories . "
noreview,synopsis : bobby garfield ( yelchin ) lives in a small town with his mirthless widowed mother ( hope davis ) . 
noreview,"bobby's world revolves around his friends , especially the spritely carol ( boorem ) . "
noreview,"then one day , a new boarder arrives at bobby's house . "
noreview,ted brautigan ( hopkins ) is an enigmatic man to whom bobby takes an immediate liking . 
noreview,"as the bond between bobby and ted deepens , bobby becomes privy to ted's great secret , an event which will change both of their lives forever . "
noreview,"review : a small but enchanting movie , "" hearts in atlantis "" easily recalls another king-inspired coming-of-age film , "" stand by me "" , both in terms of its setting and the sentiment it conveys . "
noreview,"synopsis : in this movie , steven spielberg , one of today's finest directors , attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - - a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners . "
noreview,"cinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders , but since the americans don't speak cinque's language , the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves . "
noreview,"technically , since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time , people like cinque couldn't be kidnapped into slavery ; one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave . "
noreview,"lawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery , rather than born slaves , in order to get them out of prison as free men . "
noreview,"three lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg's trademark panache - - flashy beginning , lots of facial close-ups , big music , and dramatic imagery . "
noreview,a final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters . 
noreview,opinion : making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life . 
noreview,"in fiction , one invents purposeful , clear-cut good guys and bad guys , puts the fictional characters in conflict , and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion . "
noreview,"real life , however , consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around , think thoughts and do nothing , or come and go before events are resolved . "
noreview,spielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story . 
noreview,djimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances . 
noreview,the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do . 
noreview,"lives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment's notice . "
noreview,"the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower . "
noreview,"most of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants . "
noreview,it takes a pretty smart person to do that . 
noreview,but what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ? 
noreview,what if he's also able to think on his feet ? 
noreview,"in fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? "
noreview,it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray's the negotiator . 
noreview,"in this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force . "
noreview,"when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman's home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder . "
noreview,"faced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain's office . "
noreview,"i don't quite remember if the captain actually said , "" i hate to do this , but . . . "" , "
noreview,although it wouldn't surprise me if he did . 
noreview,"luckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above . "
noreview,"after being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t . "
noreview,"walsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed . "
noreview,"although roman's actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue . "
noreview,"jackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman . "
noreview,"the actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats . "
noreview,the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence . 
noreview,"how can we believe he's going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ? "
noreview,"unfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it's would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson's acting ability . "
noreview,"almost every time he's in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back . "
noreview,"when spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course . "
noreview,his is an interesting character . 
noreview,"made out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation . "
noreview,"plot : a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon , to whom he's devoted a tribute band in which he sings , gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place . "
noreview,critique : i'm a sucker for movies like this . 
noreview,"a young man with a humble background and lofty dreams , works hard , devotes the time , the energy and the patience , and ultimately hits it big-time . "
noreview,"in the case of this film , our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it ( yup , luck always finds its way into these types of equations , although generally tied very closely to hard work ) , they need a new singer . "
noreview,"his entry and adaptation to the whole "" rock 'n roll "" lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch . "
noreview,although i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love ( or past love ) of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it . 
noreview,"metal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isn't that prominent anymore , i still check out my motley crue , twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again . "
noreview,"that's not to say that you won't like this film if you don't like the music , but the music and live performances from the band , play a big part in the movie , and i for one , had a blast watching and listening to it all . "
noreview,but the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg . 
noreview,"wow , hand this fella some major props , as he totally becomes this heavy metal geek/god ( incidentally , metal god was the film's original title , and a much better one if you ask me ) . "
noreview,he is this movie and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through . 
noreview,"he came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic , who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams . "
noreview,"aniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend ( and the romance angle between them was sweet ) , but she didn't pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes . "
noreview,"i was also impressed by some of the "" real "" musicians who played in the film ( zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne , jeff pilson from dokken , stephan jenkins from third eye blind , blas elias from slaughter ) , but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members . "
noreview,"it's to note that this film was based on a real-life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer ( their original singer also admitted to being gay , as in this film ) . "
noreview,"just for the record , i'm certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements , since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies , but because it's a fun , uplifting , well-paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances . "
noreview,"oh yeah , and for those who dig the "" heavier "" side of music , the soundtrack also rocks ! ! "
noreview,you see . . . dreams 
noreview,can come true . . . 
noreview,carry on matron is the last great carry-on film in my opinion . 
noreview,"made in 1972 , it still features most of the regulars of this genre . "
noreview,"sid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit , kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting , head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac , hattie jacques re-takes her role as matron , and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr . goode . "
noreview,"the jokes come in fast and so do the laughs , with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard . "
noreview,"this time , williams is after matron ( jacques ) when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr . goode . "
noreview,"the doctor ( hawtrey ) is sworn to secrecy : - "" i assure you , that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other ! "" "
noreview,bernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself . 
noreview,"there are great cameos from joan sims , an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene , and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he's at work ( at the railway station ) . "
noreview,sid james' gang including cyril his son ( kenneth cope ) try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home . 
noreview,he has to share a room with nurse ball ( barbara windsor ) and she soon sees through him ! 
noreview,the film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospital's pills with panic ensuing . 
noreview,"there are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron , however her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous 'matron's' . "
noreview,"williams is , as usual , on top form , but sid james isn't given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all . "
noreview,"the same does not go for charles hawtrey , for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone and has scarce screen time , he seems to steal every scene he is in . "
noreview,"by not making use of sid james and barbara windsor's talent to full effect , the film seems to flounder , but it certainly makes up for it with it's good storyline and it's other appealing characters . "
noreview,this film is genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored ! 
noreview,"the ultimate match up between good and evil , "" the untouchables "" is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry . "
noreview,"based on the 1959 television show of the same title , "" the untouchables "" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script . "
noreview,the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public . 
noreview,elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order . 
noreview,"however , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws . "
noreview,the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes . 
noreview,"the film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws . "
noreview,the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl . 
noreview,"from this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard . "
noreview,"right from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs . "
noreview,"this developed hatred is before the film's hero , ness , is even introduced . "
noreview,i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone . 
noreview,the film only gets better from this point . 
noreview,"with the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats . "
noreview,they walk in unison and they only look forward . 
noreview,as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens . 
noreview,"holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films . "
noreview,"one that comes to mind is "" the matrix "" when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world . "
noreview,"wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930's style , the similarities between these two are countless . "
noreview,"having not seen , "" who framed roger rabbit "" in over 10 years , and not remembering much besides that i liked it then , i decided to rent it recently . "
noreview,watching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is . 
noreview,"aside from the fact that it's a milestone in animation in movies ( it's the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters , have them interact , and make it convincingly real ) and a great entertainment it's also quite an effective comedy/mystery . "
noreview,"while the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original , especially baby herman , and watching them together is a lot of fun . "
noreview,the story begins in hollywood in 1947 . 
noreview,"cartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work , so hard-boiled private detective eddie valiant ( bob hoskins ) is called in by studio head r . k . "
noreview,maroon ( alan tilvern ) to try to help get roger's mind back on work . 
noreview,"maroon thinks that roger's wife , jessica's , possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots . "
noreview,"valiant takes some photos of jessica playing , `patty cake' with marvin acme ( stubby kaye ) , the owner of toontown ( where all of the cartoon characters live ) and takes them to maroon . "
noreview,"upon seeing them , roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect . "
noreview,the rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town ( and eventually toontown ) trying to clear roger's good name . 
noreview,along the way they meet judge doom ( christopher lloyd ) a judge-jury-and executioner type who's out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a `toon . ' 
noreview,`who framed roger rabbit' won 4 academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters ( williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in ) . 
noreview,"director robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production , which included hundreds of animators . "
noreview,also bob hoskins' performance should be credited . 
noreview,"he , in addition to the rest of the human cast , finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co-stars . "
noreview,"according to the internet movie database , hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off . "
noreview,`who framed roger rabbit' is a rare film . 
noreview,one that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family ( although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom ) . 
noreview,"do yourself a favor and rent it , `p-p-p-p-please . "" "
noreview,there's something about ben stiller that makes him a popular choice among casting directors these days . 
noreview,"stiller currently has three projects in circulation , and what other actor can lay claim to that ? "
noreview,"he's in "" there's something about mary , "" which i * still * haven't seen . "
noreview,"and he's in the acerbic "" your friends & neighbors , "" playing a talkative , sexually-frustrated drama coach called jerri . "
noreview,"now there's "" permanent midnight , "" in which stiller plays another jerry , this one a heroin-addicted television writer , last name stahl . "
noreview,there's also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drug-addiction pictures the minute they've proved themselves commercially . 
noreview,"ewan mcgregor springs to mind who , after successful turns in "" emma "" and "" brassed off , "" received greater respect and admiration for his mind-blowing realization as renton in danny boyle's transatlantic junk-fest , "" trainspotting . "" "
noreview,"the philosophy appears to be a simple one : if you want 'em to be taken seriously , make 'em do drugs . "
noreview," permanent midnight "" is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl , a successful hollywood writer who , in the mid-eighties , had a $5 , 000-a-week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a $6 , 000-a-week heroin habit . a habit , in stahl's own words , "" the size of utah .  "
noreview,"as stahl , stiller contributes a commanding performance . "
noreview,"unlike "" trainspotting , "" which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse , "" permanent midnight "" instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance . "
noreview,"one of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to "" naked lunch "" author william s . burroughs who , when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds , "" so i can shave . "" "
noreview,"stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in "" permanent midnight "" ; it's so he can talk to his mother on the phone , show up for work on time , even pay his bills . "
noreview,"while the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl , the writing ( adapted from stahl's autobiography by director david veloz ) is controlled and pointed . "
noreview,by phil curtolo mel gibson ( braveheart ) gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howard's ransom . 
noreview,"gibson plays tom mullen , a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath , played by gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , and his band of low-life thugs kidnap his only son for $2 million . "
noreview,"tom and his wife , kate , played by rene russo ( tin cup ) were instructed not to inform the police , but they contacted the fbi . "
noreview,"minutes later , an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo ( broken arrow ) are in tom's house and wiring every phone . "
noreview,"the plot sounds average , just like most other kidnap movies that you've already seen , and it was nothing more than that . "
noreview,that is until about half-way through the movie . 
noreview,"suddenly , tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying , "" this is your ransom . "
noreview,but this is as close as you will ever get to it . 
noreview,"instead , i am offering this money as a reward on your head , dead or alive . "" "
noreview,"at this point , the plot thickened , and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense-filled action film with great stunts . "
noreview,the last half of the film is very well done . 
noreview,"another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise , as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie . "
noreview,"owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject : "" it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones . "" "
noreview,"before this movie , sinise played mostly "" good guys , "" first in of mice & men , then in forrest gump , and most recently , in apollo 13 . "
noreview,but he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of a cop-gone-bad . 
noreview,"gibson , of course , was just being gibson , in an oscar-worthy performance . "
noreview,"although most of the scenes were quite predictable , ransom is a very entertaining and suspenseful film . "
noreview,one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction . 
noreview,"the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy , innocent fun . "
noreview,sometimes the stories are compelling . 
noreview,sometimes they're not . 
noreview,"but , with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) , i've never been bored by any of the enterprise's numerous missions . "
noreview,star trek : insurrection is no exception . 
noreview,"the film has gotten some negative reviews ( a friend of mine actually thinks it's the worst in the series ) , but i'm not really sure why . "
noreview,"it's an exciting , often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film . "
noreview,"some say it's a bit too light , and more of a long episode than a film . "
noreview,others say the special effects are cheesy and that it's boring . 
noreview,i simply enjoyed the film . 
noreview,"insurrection , which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast , introduces us to a race of people called the ba'ku ; the ba'ku are very old ( most of them are about three hundred years old ) , but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet . "
noreview,"of course , these peaceful people can't horde this fountain of youth all for themselves ? leave it up to their archenemies , the son'a , led by ru'afo ( f . "
noreview,"murray abraham ) , to mess everything up . "
noreview,"the son'a , who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable , strike a deal with the federation to move the ba'ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying . "
noreview,that's when captain picard ( patrick stewart ) steps in : he realizes that moving the ba'ku would kill them ( it also helps that he falls in love with a ba'ku woman ( donna murphy ) ) . 
noreview,"so , with his trusty crew , picard defies the federation to keep the ba'ku in their natural habitat . "
noreview,"when dealing with a series with as much history as this , it's not entirely necessary to re-introduce your characters with each episode . "
noreview,"this is why i believe non-fans have a hard time getting into star trek ; in order to enjoy it , one has to understand how to approach it . "
noreview,"insurrection , however , does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters . "
noreview,"stewart is bold as always , a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together . "
noreview,"jonathan frakes , who also directed , is funny as commander riker ; a subplot with data ( brent spiner ) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting ; and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain , overacting like crazy . "
noreview,"frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact ; insurrection is an exciting film , with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action . "
noreview,"this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation , and the result is very pleasing to the eye : particularly in the climactic scenes , in which the son'a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba'ku planet , the special effects have a clean , impressively sharp look . "
noreview,"if i have any complaint about the film , it's that it tries to take a moral stance when it's not very appropriate to do so . "
noreview,i don't think it's that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba'ku in order to save the lives of thousands . 
noreview,"better yet , why couldn't they have co-existed ? "
noreview,insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience . 
noreview,"with it's inherent camp factor , the star trek series doesn't seem well-equipped to deal with issues like this . "
noreview,i prefer to just enjoy the spectacle . 
noreview,a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july ! 
noreview,">from ace ventura to truman burbank , jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic , yet sympathetic , characters . "
noreview,"1996's the cable guy was supposed to be his big "" breakthrough "" role from zany humor into darker , more dramatic acting . "
noreview,"as most everyone knows , the results were , well , less-than-stellar . "
noreview,"not only did the film not do so hot at the box office , but it was also panned by critics . "
noreview,"as far as i know , gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it . "
noreview,"the first time i saw the cable guy , in theatres , i was in super critic-mode , and didn't really like it . "
noreview,"however , due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day , i've had time to lean back , relax , and take in the film . "
noreview,"and to my surprise , it grew on me . "
noreview,"the plot is rather simple : broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy , played by carrey , then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship . "
noreview,"see , steven's been having some problems with his girlfriend , robin ( leslie mann ) , and he doesn't think he has any more room in his life for a new friend . "
noreview,"also , some of the cable guy's antics have been creeping him out . "
noreview,"carrey , as the cable guy , gives steven various aliases , which later we find out are all tv characters : larry tate , chip douglas , ricky ricardo , etc . he apparently lives in his cable van , and while many critics didn't enjoy this newer , darker , less-manic performance from carrey , i thought it was interesting and rather well-done . "
noreview,"for me , its not the movie as a whole that's enjoyable , but rather several individual scenes : a karaoke jam at steven's apartment , a medieval fight at a theme restaurant , and a bathroom beating ( a la liar , liar ) , just to name a few . "
noreview,perhaps the fact that more of carrey's humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny . 
noreview,"and if you really want to see something , you've got to hear his version of jefferson airplane's "" somebody to love "" , sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam . "
noreview,"the cable guy has its bad spots , like most any movie . "
noreview,"i didn't particularly like steven's girlfriend , and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend . "
noreview,"also , the ending , while having you fooled for a moment , is rather contrived , and somewhat dissapointing . "
noreview,"still , i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture ; if you're at the video store and can't think of anything to rent , i suggest you try it out . "
noreview,"or if you have hbo , just wait till it comes on ( you won't have to wait long . ) "
noreview,"hell , that's what i do every day . "
noreview,"when bulworth ended , i allowed myself a sigh of relief : ? it is possible for me to enjoy political satire . ? "
noreview,"there have been several recent political films that didn't do a whole lot for me -- wag the dog , for instance , i found to be an intelligent but heartless film , while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness . ? "
noreview,"bulworth is a far better film than these , both in its execution and lasting impression . ? "
noreview,"it's a tremendously funny and intelligent picture , but it also has an emotional center -- writer/director/star warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his character , and , in turn , we like him and actually care about the story . "
noreview, ? 
noreview,beatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth ; the film opens and we see bulworth sobbing as he watches his television spots over and over again . ? 
noreview,"he hasn't slept in days , nor has he eaten , and , almost instantaneously , he goes insane . "
noreview," ? he's not stark raving mad ( not outright , anyway ) , but he's definitely bonkers . "
noreview," ? it's the final weekend of his campaign , and his assistant , murphy ( oliver platt ) has written him a speech to feed to a group of black people in a church in the ghetto . "
noreview," ? bulworth begins the speech , but suddenly goes off track and just starts being honest . ? "
noreview," you mean , "" one lady asks , "" the democratic party doesn't care about the african american community ? "" ?  "" well , "" he shouts , laughing , "" isn't that obvious ?  "
noreview,the story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract on his own life ( he muses later that it's a bad thing to make decisions when you're suicidal ) ; he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses ( graham beckel ) whom he believes to be the hitman . 
noreview, ? bulworth also meets nina ( halle berry ) with whom he becomes infatuated . 
noreview," ? suddenly , in the short span of this weekend , bulworth's no-nonsense "" truth in politics "" methods become a national sensation , and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that he's appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences . "
noreview,beatty's work on both sides of the camera is excellent . ? 
noreview,"his script and direction are both extremely sharp , as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself . ? "
noreview,"here is a man who's reached his limit , and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure . ? "
noreview,"i like that the film doesn't take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations , but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich ( although the anti-rich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film ) . ? "
noreview,"some of the segments are simply hilarious , such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him . ? "
noreview,"much of the film is completely absurd , but that's the fun part about it . ? "
noreview,"it's an angry , serious film at the core , but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre . ? "
noreview,what adds to this feeling is beatty's portrayal of bulworth ; this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale . 
noreview," ? beatty is so much fun to watch here -- he's always funny , but he's also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions . "
noreview," ? beatty is so good that bulworth , despite his shortcomings as a human being , is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning . "
noreview,the supporting cast is vast and colorful . ? 
noreview,"berry is luminous , as always , and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles . ? "
noreview,don cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun-toting toddlers to do his dirty work . ? 
noreview,"oliver platt is an actor who should be careful , for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting ( though he's very funny to watch ) . ? paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections . "
noreview,is bulworth offensive ? ? 
noreview,i suppose some may see it that way . ? 
noreview,"i wasn't offended by the film , but then again , i hardly care about politics . ? "
noreview,i think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story . ? 
noreview,"the film isn't perfect , of course -- the ending didn't quite work for me , and the a few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced ( although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic ) . ? "
noreview,but these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film . ? 
noreview,"bulworth is a smart , uproariously funny picture that proves to me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface . ? "
noreview,"call 911 for the cliche police if you must , but the eyes are the window to the soul . "
noreview,"the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze : paul newman , ralph fiennes , anthony hopkins , morgan freeman . "
noreview,"you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds , that the characters they play are real human beings . "
noreview,"we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor , but he had that unique quality in his eyes . "
noreview,"in gridlock'd , an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire , shakur and his co-star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry . "
noreview,"shakur and roth play ezekiel "" spoon "" whitmore and alexander "" stretch "" rome , two detroit buddies who share a spoken word/jazz trio , an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie ( thandie newton ) . "
noreview,"when a new year's eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose , spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time . "
noreview,"they soon make a new year's resolution to get into rehab , but that proves to be easier said than done . "
noreview,"as though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough , spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy , confusion and red tape . "
noreview,"the government might be the least of their obstacles , however , as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer , and on the run from a nasty thug ( vondie curtis hall ) . "
noreview,"in order for you to buy into gridlock'd at all , you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism ; unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie , they are going to government offices on new year's day , in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all . "
noreview,"gridlock'd may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey , 1991's falling down , which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles . "
noreview,"in falling down , michael douglas' d-fens ( the character's personalized license plate , echoed in gridlock'd by the drug lord d-reper's plates ) whips out a gun because he can't get breakfast at mcdonald's ; in gridlock'd , spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center . "
noreview,"and where the unhinged d-fens became a heroic surrogate for audiences , writer/director vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation . "
noreview,"one bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question , "" do you expect the world to stop . . . just "
noreview,"because you picked _today_ to clean up ? "" "
noreview,"the world in gridlock'd is just as frustrating as the world in falling down , but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time . "
noreview,"hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system , but perhaps not enough of them . "
noreview,"a significant chunk of gridlock'd is devoted to spoon and stretch's flight from d-reper and from the police , and those sub-plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments . "
noreview,"in one scene , stretch scares off d-reper by getting chummy with a police officer ; another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly-suspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures . "
noreview,"the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running , while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time . "
noreview,"hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film's main events , perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self-destructive behavior . "
noreview,"oh , the irony of it . "
noreview,"tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case , and living the life to back it up . "
noreview,"in gridlock'd , shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him . "
noreview,"spoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall , but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction . "
noreview,"mostly it comes through those eyes , eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta . "
noreview,"it is spoon who plays conscience to stretch's pure appetite , and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self-destructiveness ( he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again ) which is as much an obstacle to spoon's goal as any agency or enemy . "
noreview,"gridlock'd's most cruelly comic scene finds stretch "" helping "" spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife , and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him . "
noreview,"with friends like that , spoon doesn't need enemies , and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much . "
noreview,the tragedy now is that we won't get more chances to see those eyes again . 
noreview,"hilarious , ultra-low budget comedy from film school dropout kevin smith chronicles a day in the life of two convenience store slackers ( brian o'halloran and jeff anderson ) . "
noreview,they spend most of their day ignoring customers while discussing everything from fellatio to self-fulfillment . 
noreview,"the premise is strictly sitcom and the photography is grainy as all get-out , but you could spend ten times the film's budget ( a reported $27 , 000 ) and still not get dialogue half as good as this . "
noreview,originally rated nc-17 for language . 
noreview,not recommended for viewers with sensitive ears . 
noreview,killing zoe =========== 
noreview,"remake reservoir dogs as a french art film and you're halfway to killing zoe , writer/director roger avary's slow-moving story of a failed bastille day bank robbery . "
noreview,eric stoltz stars as an american in paris who gets in * way * over his head when hooks up with a band of nihilistic bank robbers . 
noreview,he's the safecracker who's blissful unaware that the bank job is a botch job from the word go . 
noreview,"though intriguing on all fronts , the film is paced at half the speed of pulp fiction , which avary co-wrote with quentin tarantino . "
noreview,in english and french . 
noreview,the road to wellville ===================== 
noreview,"based on the novel by t . coraghessan boyle , the road to wellville doesn't go very far . "
noreview,"bowels , bowels , and more bowels are explored by dr . john harvey kellogg ( a buck-toothed and bespectacled anthony hopkins ) , who , in the early 1900's , advocated abstinence , vegetarianism , and frequent defecation . "
noreview,he also invented the cornflake . 
noreview,really . 
noreview,"checking-in to kellogg's battle creek sanitarium are matthew broderick and bridget fonda , just two of the many well-known faces in this failed comedy . "
noreview,"leave your laughter at the door and you can marvel at the unfunny antics of john cusack , michael lerner , lara flynn boyle , john neville , and dana carvey . "
noreview,"the art direction is impeccable and some of the early sequences are amusing , but the novelty quickly wears off as writer/director alan parkers tries his darnedness to turn doo-doo into drama . "
noreview,what he ends up with is something that i can't print here . 
noreview,phew ! 
noreview,stargate ======== 
noreview,lawrence of arabia meets star wars . 
noreview,this epic sci-fi film is more sheer spectacle than anything else . 
noreview,director roland emmerich ( universal solider ) shamelessly rips off lucas and spielberg and just about any other cosmic cliche that he can lay his hands on . 
noreview,"the film is overlong , the characters are cardboard , and the script is filled with some of the most laughable details in modern sci-fi history . "
noreview,"that said , there's still plenty to watch here . "
noreview,"sci-fi fans should enjoy the sculpted sands , the morphing headdresses , and a surprisingly spunky james spader . "
noreview,"he plays the egyptologist who gets to prove his theory that that "" somebody else "" built the pyramids . "
noreview,less interesting are co-stars kurt russell and jaye davidson of crying game fame . 
noreview,star trek generations ===================== 
noreview,"trek fans may be more forgiving , but , for the rest of us , the sluggish star trek generations is a mixed bag at best . "
noreview,"the story is interesting , but each scene goes too long . "
noreview,"the cast is earnest , but the direction lacks punch . "
noreview,and so on . 
noreview, ( the best example of the latter is a klingon comeuppance that delivers none of the impact of a similar scene in star trek ii . ) 
noreview,"original enterprise captain james t . kirk appears on both ends of the story , though they cut the scene where shatner turns to the screen to plead "" get a life . "" "
noreview,remarkably unremarkable . 
noreview,miracle on 34th street ====================== 
noreview,"in a season of the specialist and pulp fiction et al , maybe a remake of miracle on 34th street * is * necessary . "
noreview,john hughes certainly believes in santa claus and his les mayfield-directed production does nothing to tarnish the memory of the 1947 original . 
noreview,"the romance between costars dylan mcdermott and elizabeth perkins doesn't work too well , but the film makes a strong case that richard attenborough is the definitive kriss kringle . "
noreview,his chemistry with children can moisten any eye . 
noreview,no claus for alarm . 
noreview,junior ====== 
noreview,arnold schwarzenegger pregnant ? 
noreview,"sure , billy crystal did it before in rabbit test , but the sight of schwarz with a bulging belly is a casting coup comparable to dustin hoffman in tootsie . "
noreview,what should be nothing more than a one-joke premise actually gets better as it goes along . 
noreview,"director ivan reitman ( dave , twins ) wisely keeps the farce to a minimum , so the first hour moves slower than you might expect . "
noreview,"don't expect too many yuks from danny devito , but you can't beat those early romantic scenes between emma and arnie . "
noreview,how's * that * for a collision of acting styles ? 
noreview,"for those of us who weren't yet born when the 1960's rock 'n' rolled around , monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies . "
noreview,"from otis redding to jimi hendrix , janis joplin to the mamas and the papas , and jefferson airplane to the who , this documentary is jam-packed with contagious energy . "
noreview,"but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending , which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves . "
noreview,"shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock , the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time . "
noreview,"sure , some have painted their faces and smoke joints , but d . a . "
noreview,"pennebaker ( the war room , moon over broadway ) surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience . "
noreview,"no matter who is watching , it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul . "
noreview,the excitement starts before the music even begins . 
noreview,"a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer , she replies that she feels lucky to do so . "
noreview,"there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips , leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers , tries to get in touch with dionne warwick . "
noreview,"and when one band is tuning up , a member remarks , "" finally , a decent sound system ! "" "
noreview,"you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn't about vanity , it's about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it , a two-way street . "
noreview,this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience . 
noreview,it's impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain . 
noreview,"and while the lyrics to "" wild thing "" may not be all that complicated , watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love . "
noreview,"even if you don't recognize every band you see on stage , you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats . "
noreview,"the only drawback to the film is the ending , which unfortunately i must reveal . "
noreview,"all the other bands , big names then and still today , got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time . "
noreview,"in contrast , the last band on camera , a wholly forgettable one , gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time . "
noreview,"for a film that's only 78 minutes long , that's too large of a chunk , especially when previous acts are much more stimulating . "
noreview,"all in all , monterey pop is a precious , rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us . "
noreview,"the variety of music , as well as the beautifully shot performances , are easy to become immersed in . "
noreview,"if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular , this is quickly dispelled . "
noreview,it's almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn't get made much anymore . 
noreview,"instead we're stuck with * nsync , the backstreet boys , and jennifer lopez , all of whom should have stuck with modeling . "
noreview,"the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages . "
noreview,"martin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime . "
noreview,"unfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola's influence on mafia portrayals in the movies . "
noreview,seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime . 
noreview,"this film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s . "
noreview,"goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) . "
noreview,"the book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york . "
noreview,"at the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands . "
noreview,"after couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) . "
noreview,"three of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history . "
noreview,"wealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business . "
noreview,"but the perfect world of "" wiseguys "" gradually begins to fall apart - tommy's unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy's reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry's own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends . "
noreview,goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory . 
noreview,scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker . 
noreview,world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating . 
noreview,"scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny . "
noreview,"after being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens . "
noreview,"scorsese also manages to break viewer's moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience . "
noreview,"with the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character's dialogue or narrator's commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era . "
noreview,"even if we don't pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker . "
noreview,"first , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie's ironic prologue . "
noreview,"then , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards . "
noreview,"this multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation . "
noreview,same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack . 
noreview,"nostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s . "
noreview,"but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed . "
noreview,"however , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people . "
noreview,"such scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s . "
noreview,"fragmentary character of the screenplay , which doesn't have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese . "
noreview,"he uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious "" a day in life "" segment near the end of the film . "
noreview,another essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents . 
noreview,"the most respectable among them is robert de niro , but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues . "
noreview,"joe pesci deserved his "" oscar "" for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy , and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film . "
noreview,"ray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps doesn't look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film . "
noreview,liotta's henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs . 
noreview,"liotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction . "
noreview,"lorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband . "
noreview,"paul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso , and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave . "
noreview,"as a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time . "
noreview,"because of this achievement , and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers , this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s . "
noreview," the blair witch project "" was perhaps one of a kind , a unique film that played completely on its own merit , managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses . its success made a sequel inevitable , but this is not the sequel , i suspect , anyone much wanted . after the release of "" the blair witch project "" , tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville , in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch . locals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity , selling twig-sculptures , stones and dirt like those in the movie , and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn , shouting , "" get out of these woods and go home ! there is no goddamned blair witch ! "" . jeff ( ) is one of those people , who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage . after he got released from the mental institution , he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet . as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods , on the "" blair witch hunt "" . among the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend , the pregnant tristen , who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called "" the blair witch : history or hysteria ? "" , and kim , who dresses in black and has some psychic powers . the last member of the crew is erica , a young beautiful witch-wannabe , who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore , saying "" the first rule of wicca is , do no harm , because whatever you do will come back to you threefold .  "
noreview,"this strange group plunges into the woods , where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience . "
noreview,"on the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parr's abandoned house , strange things start happening . "
noreview,when they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain . 
noreview,after a while they discover strange markings on their bodies . 
noreview,"they are somehow lost in time , as it loops uncontrollably back and forth . "
noreview,they are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality . 
noreview,the only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods . . 
noreview,"documentary director joe berlinger ( "" paradice lost "" ) helms "" blair witch 2 "" , leaving the creators of the first film ( dan myrick and ed sanches ) in the background . "
noreview,"the opening scenes--the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film-- is a more promising approach , because instead of trying to cover similar ground , it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand . "
noreview,"but soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story , that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue . "
noreview,"in a way , this is a typical hollywood sequel . "
noreview,more money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail . 
noreview,the horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated . 
noreview,"of course in these situations , quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values . "
noreview,"from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody-red forest , with carter burwell's ( "" being john malkovich "" and "" fargo "" ) musical score in the background , you realize that with the exception of its title , this film has absolutely nothing to do with "" the blair witch project "" . "
noreview, blair witch . .  
noreview,was filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation . 
noreview,"in the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection , creating a completely different atmosphere . "
noreview,"with its graceful cinematography , production design and flashy editing , the film has a very polished look , which is impossible to associate with the first installment . "
noreview,"and though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times , he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor . "
noreview,the key is simplicity . 
noreview,"seen may 31 , 1999 on home video ( rented ) . "
noreview,"one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise . "
noreview,"with some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with `dark city' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie . "
noreview,"there's an old role-playing computer game called `d ? ja v ? ' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there . "
noreview,the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict . 
noreview,"the premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don't have control over the protagonist . "
noreview,"we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it's more than just the city , it's the whole reality ) that isn't just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman , ' `blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it's almost a different genre completely . "
noreview,"later he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what's going on other than the fact something is not right . "
noreview,"the fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling . "
noreview,"this opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone . "
noreview,the man doesn't know who he is nor where he's going and it's interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him . 
noreview,"in fact , this is the way all stories begin since it's impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc . until after we've observed them for a while . "
noreview,"but in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story . "
noreview,"eventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police . "
noreview,"we met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time . "
noreview,"two other important characters are also introduced : dr . daniel p . schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john's doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies . "
noreview,it was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film . 
noreview,"he also contacts emma , which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story . "
noreview,"but absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city , ' which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo . "
noreview,"everything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design , they don't seem to be able to afford any gratuities . "
noreview,"however , that might also be what's keeping it from reaching its maximum potential . "
noreview,"by continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know , we come to realize that it's all a hoax . "
noreview,everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction . 
noreview,"but , as the film's tagline says , `last night , one of us went off . ' "
noreview,"for reasons that are never clearly explained , it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as `tuning' ) . "
noreview,"the aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight . "
noreview,"at the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made , they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then . "
noreview,this premise certainly is interesting and director and co-screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard . 
noreview,he does provide some explanations such as that dr . schreber is an assistant to `the strangers' because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form . 
noreview,the aliens mix and match the memories of the city's population to see who will change and who will not . 
noreview,"in the process this creates for a good deal of deep , thought-provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world . "
noreview,"however , where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is . "
noreview,"the main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened , yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant , static and cold ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don't help either ) . "
noreview,"for example , john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her , yet in some scenes crucial to the film's plot , we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other , which is also part of the film's climax and ending . "
noreview,"and that's what proyas seems to be inferring with the film , but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense . "
noreview,"ironically , this is what made his first film `the crow' work so well , which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical , dark twisted world . "
noreview,with `dark city' the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message . 
noreview,"still , the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable . "
noreview,"there's a lot to like here , most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does . "
noreview,the story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years . 
noreview,`dark city' is what the movies are all about - the escape from the real world . 
noreview,"linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction , and her being cast as dogma's lead is nothing short of inexplicable . "
noreview,"she's still in fine form as bethany , an abortion clinic worker who's lost her faith . "
noreview,"one night , a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany's bedroom . "
noreview,"he is metatron ( alan rickman ) , the voice of god , and he needs her help : she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey church-the fate of the universe depends on it . "
noreview,"god would do it him/herself , but he/she is . . . missing , having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again . "
noreview,"bethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the "" prophets "" jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( kevin smith , doing double-duty ) , the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith's films thus far . "
noreview,"at some point , rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus , the undocumented ( and very black ) "" thirteenth apostle "" , and offers his assistance , as does divine stripper serendipity ( salma hayek ) . "
noreview,it's a wild ride . 
noreview,"they're in pursuit of loki and bartleby ( damon and affleck , respectively-this is probably the sharpest either has ever been ) , who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return . "
noreview,loki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates . 
noreview,"at one point , he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets . "
noreview,"it's a nasty , guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks , "" how corrupt are you ? "" . "
noreview,wings of desire this ain't . 
noreview,"since debuting with clerks , smith has grown as a director , particularly in terms of working with actors . "
noreview," ( chris rock is this film's only weak link-between jokes , he's wooden . ) "
noreview,"his no-frills visual style hasn't changed much over the years , though ( dogma's widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations ) , nor has his writing-his characters still sit around delivering one caustic , hilarious speech after another . "
noreview,"dogma chips away at big religious issues-namely , the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately , but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition . "
noreview,"as well , the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever . "
noreview,"any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum ( hurlyburly , anyone ? ) , and eventually dogma's pacing goes slack . "
noreview,"a long diatribe from bartleby late in the game , in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings , comes at a point when we've heard enough . "
noreview,"because his change of heart ( bartleby is initially the good cop to loki's bad ) drives the climax , said rant is given a great deal of screen time . "
noreview,"sure , affleck deserved a big moment ( damon steals their scenes together prior ) , but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated . "
noreview,"like tarantino , smith was a video-age sponge who became a sample-mad indie filmmaker . "
noreview,"dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies , including indiana jones and the last crusade , with silent bob doing his best harrison ford , and weird science-a shit demon attacks our heroes ! "
noreview,"smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour : his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical ( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan "" catholicism wow ! "" ) and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished . "
noreview,i bust ( ed ? ) a gut on several occasions . 
noreview,proceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever . 
noreview,"it's a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease , for to read it , one actually has to see dogma . "
noreview,"the prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ's , martin scorsese's 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis' controversial novel , in that it is not directly linked to the picture's content but to rumours and heresy . "
noreview,"there's a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime , just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against . "
noreview, ( not one of them had watched it . ) 
noreview,every single person refused . 
noreview,"smith and scorsese have a lot in common , and so do the two films in question , because both smith's bethany and scorsese's jesus are hollow shells without their faith . "
noreview,"in fact , dogma's denouement ( which follows a thrilling showdown that's worth the wait ) is a catholic love-in , a veritable recruitment poster . "
noreview, ( i felt sentimental about a religion i don't belong to . 
noreview,"now that's powerful filmmaking . ) smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god , and that spirituality shines through . "
noreview,it's enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins . 
noreview,my religion is movies . 
noreview,"when the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine , in a roundabout way they're attacking what i live for : freedom of expression through celluloid . "
noreview,"i therefore feel that , although i'm no bible-thumper , i'm at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers . "
noreview,you've heard all the hype . 
noreview,"you've seen all their faces - natalie portman ( the professional ) as queen amidala , liam neeson ( schindler's list ) as qui-gon jinn , ewan mcgregor ( trainspotting ) as obi-wan kenobi , and jake lloyd ( jingle all the way ) as young anakin skywalker . "
noreview,"if you've read any reviews , you've also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy . "
noreview,"you also may have heard that this one's too kiddie-friendly , and doesn't have enough content for adults . "
noreview,believe the hype . 
noreview,"the effects are stunning , the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic , the lightsaber duels are amazing , and queen amidala's sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth . "
noreview,"but there's something missing here , and it isn't budget or effects - it's everything money * can't * buy . "
noreview,the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad-stroked and flat characters . 
noreview,"the most successful at this is liam neeson who , as qui-gon jinn , a jedi master to young obi-wan kenobi , has quiet dignity and a wise , commanding presence . "
noreview,"he is the anchor to this movie , as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out . "
noreview,portman's queen amidala and mcgregor's obi-wan kenobi don't fare nearly so well . 
noreview,"amidala , the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) . "
noreview,"and obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he's nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn's batman . "
noreview,"however , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job . "
noreview,"he also absolutely nails alec guiness' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise . "
noreview,"in fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that's one of the problems with this film . "
noreview,"i would never call myself a "" star wars "" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i've always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america . "
noreview,"however , if you are the one person in america who * hasn't * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn't bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost . "
noreview,"for example , one of the film's main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine . "
noreview,"for those of you not recently steeped in "" star wars "" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader's master in "" return of the jedi "" and "" empire strikes back . "" "
noreview,"so , obviously , his appearance in "" phantom menace "" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful . "
noreview,a lot of the movie is like that . 
noreview,"r2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it's obvious that lucas is banking on the audience's pre-existing fondness for them . . . "
noreview,because he doesn't do much to add to it in any way . 
noreview,"same goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn't look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy . "
noreview,"even * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from "" empire strikes back "" ) , and alderaan ( leia's home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in "" star wars "" ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing . "
noreview,what's the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ? 
noreview,the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty . 
noreview,"there's no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be . "
noreview,another problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film . 
noreview,"i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters . "
noreview,"and jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast . "
noreview,"unlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you'll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive "" teenage mutant ninja turtles . "" "
noreview,"furthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot . "
noreview,"oddly , this isn't just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids . "
noreview,"well , he's done a good job . "
noreview,"the hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy . "
noreview,"that's not jake lloyd's fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him . "
noreview,"that's another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader . "
noreview,warning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! 
noreview,"in my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin's future evil in the film . "
noreview,"the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there's nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie . "
noreview,"he has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine . "
noreview,but the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn't all hearts and roses is yoda's hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn . 
noreview,his explanation ? 
noreview, his future is clouded .  
noreview, ( warning : major spoiler ahead . 
noreview,enter at your own risk . ) 
noreview,"of course , the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary-looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side . "
noreview,"this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double-sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup . "
noreview,"because qui-gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi-wan , qui-gon's young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself . "
noreview,"so , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi-wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin "" darth vader "" skywalker . "
noreview,did this story need to be told ? 
noreview,i would say no . 
noreview,but is it a worthwhile movie to see ? 
noreview,absolutely . 
noreview,"if you don't enter the theater with jedi-size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , then this is your movie . "
noreview,the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation . 
noreview,the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight . 
noreview,"and yoda and young obi-wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time . "
noreview,"above all , this is a fun movie . "
noreview,"not deep , not meaningful , and not profound . "
noreview,but fun . 
noreview,"maybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co-write the script , and the guy who directed "" empire "" will direct . "
noreview,"because if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential . "

They always treat you as a family member not like an employee. please find below some points which I personally observed at my tenure there. 1) Laptops/Mac* will be provided for everyone.2) Helpful and technically strong mentors and seniors.3) I personally feel here is zero politics environment and very transparent working culture.4) Pro activeness will be always appreciated which helps you in your growth and learning opportunities.5) Company never thinks about expenses for testing devices,any type of resources for r&d and implementations on new technologies or project requirements.6)  Well maintained pantry.7) Every month there is one event schedules, in that event all developers solves public ""Apache ofbiz"" community issues with full of fun and exciting activities.8) Hotwax Media also schedules ""Master Chefs"" type of in-house activities on monthly basis.9) Good salary for freshers as well as for seniors, Bonus and other appreciations as per your performance.10) No time monitoring, flexible timings11) Get together, fun activity, outside trips etc.12) Friendly environment including with seniors and directors.I would personally recommended, this is the one of the best company in Indore (Madhya Pradesh) location for software professionals."

I worked directly under the CEO and GM of the company. Its an awesome place to work for.  I see some commenting about a CEO , you should be of his level in your career to talk abt a person. I still inspire SysCloud's CEO and Entrepreneur (My role model) and wonder how can a person work so much with this much enthusiasm."

Company is concerned about selling to new customers, not concern about retaining customers or good resources for the long term."
review,"I have been working in Microobjects for the past 5 years as a software engineer and all these years I am really enjoying my professional and personal life. I mentioned 'personal life' because we work for fulfilling our personal needs and commitments. So if someone is balancing his/her professional and personal life to a certain satisfactory level we can surely say that we achieved something in life. I have not seen any other company like MicroObjects to achieve the above stated fact. Every company has its pros and cons. If you readsome of the review of so called professional companies no one will even send the resume to them but then for a living you need a job. If someone has the habit of weeping for every issues he come across he will do the same even if employed with Goolge or even if he jobless!! I didt noticed, till date, any of my colleagues denied of his leave, which is very common in any software companies. So when you talk of flexibility it is not only the freedom to come and work as and you wish but also refers to you being available for your personal needs. Most of the 5 days working companies are just for name sake. I know many of my friends who are not even enjoying the Sundayswhereas in MicroObjects hardly people work more than 5 working days(in rare cases it happens i agree) Microobjects being located at the center of Kochi city, is the best place to looking after our every professional and personal needs.If MicroObejcts is not that a good place, I wonder Why more than 30% of employees resigned in the past are opting to come back!! So there is something which makes this company a favorite one even if we considers some cons.I read the previous review of an employee and am not completely against his observations (there is black-sheeps inside for sure). But one thing am sure that he/her is still an employee of the company!!! Even if we assume that he is an ex, after working for more than 10 years this person realised that Microobjects is not the place to work?? So please every employee of this wonderful company come together and help Microobjects grow more and more for the benefit of all employees and their families depends on it."

The previous management was let go because they couldn't align with company goals. New management is aligned with and appreciated by US office. 2. People used to get fired often and without any reason based on random personal opinions of previous management. Under new management an objective metric for measuring performance has been introduced, which helps in removing bias and decisions are now data driven rather than opinion driven. You can't improve what you cant measure is the new management philosophy.3. The Bias in previous management towards a particular team has been removed. Perfomers are appreciated irrespective of which team they belong to. 4. Performance Appraisal is now done on time and fairly for all teams, which was highly baised and unfair earlier."

review,"Being an analyst at Shopzilla I found the company has been moving forward considering employees' growth and carrier at every step. Shopzilla has their operations in many other countries like Brazil, Canada, Germany, India, Italy with headquarter based in LA, USA. Company's level one staff is very good including HR manager. The Director of the Company is very hard working and down to earth as it appears in his nature and work. Not only this the VP of India operations is also a simple person and has amazing business knowledge to proceed the company further with a positive approach. If we talk about the facilities the company is providing subsidized meal with team parties at the interval of every quarter of the year. Company's position is very good as the operations has been started recently in different countries as said above. Parking for employees, Travel allowance, subsidized meals, multi tasking environment, variable pay, events, parties, gifts, prizes, medical facility, team lunch, .One can approach Director or VP directly in case of issues if one have any.Engineering Department : Very supportiveDirector, VP, Managers, Leads all work together. Attend meetings with US, UK etc time to time. Flexible Working hours. Team spirit, Career oriented opportunities.Good Salary Package with career in Engineering, Developing, SEM, Operations departments.Happy to being a Zillian at Shopzilla."
review,"The best part is HR Team specifically the gentle lady who heads in India.  She has done wonderful job in retaining the people  and also to make ex employees realize that they should rejoin whenever they get the opportunity. She is so organised, employee friendly and understanding that you feel like sharing your problem and she does every bit of her to sort out your problem beat professional or personal.

Yes, they expect you to perform but which Organisation does not expect you to do so. Yes, they put pressure but this is corporate life.

The office was only for 50 Interns who worked along with me. I am sure they would have paid a lot. (b)\tThe Team Leaders are dedicated in the helping you learn. They put lots of pressure but at the end of the day you can do it. They make you believe in yourself. (c)\tThey have Awards & parties for the Interns. I got one award too. Very happy. (d)\tPerformance Based Stipend of Rs. 10,000 was Promised. I received the same as promised & also my mobile bills & Conveyance for work related travel. (e)\tEverything is very transparent. They Give you an Offer Letter with all Rules & Regulations in the beginning & a Good Certificate at the End. Some Other Interns who were Not Regular & Not Dedicated were complaining.

People from different functions recognize and address you by your first name. Definitely not a privilege you would enjoy at most of the other companies.Company embraces the principles of Agile and vests the entire power of decision making on the team. No hierarchy driven culture to dictate methods of execution. You have the power to create your own success!"
review,"This company has won many Workplace Excellence Awards. The company culture is geared towards technical and professional staff, Administrative (non-technical) employees are not considered as professional staff and are basically ignored making life/work balance difficult. Benefits are good and compensation is above average if you are in a technical or professional position. Plenty of job advancement for technical and professional - non-technical is underpaid for the duties required and title/salary are tied to your direct reporting manager. Company is top heavy in management and executive staff. Job Culture between employees is fair."

review,"This one is my second company and for me experience with current and previous company is really good. I really don't write blogs or review ( believe me not a single review even on flipkart products that i purchased so far :) ). This time someone is really spreading bad about the company so thought i should share my exp about Avalara.Pro's : If you are a positive minded person there are lots of thing that you can find opportunity into, but few are the bullet point which really reflects in day to day operations.- Company understands about today's trend about Husband and Wife both being working professional as a reason they provide free breakfast , Lunch and snacks (that too a good quality food). this really help's me as my wife as well is working.- Work from home option : My parents staying at native really require my attention once every 2-3 months and having this option really help me spend time and as well contribute to work.- There is a special budget allocated for team outings and that's really with individual team members to plan activities. Its really fun to go out with team enjoy the time.- I noted the salary is actually competitive per market standards ( if not why would have I been sticking with this company so far :) )- Work wise - this is product based company and you get to work on latest technology stack. Few bullet items i added to my Resume since last 12 months (AWS , Node.js and Angular JS).Overall I think this is a pretty good company for those who wants to keep learning and growing. This is not like a typical service based industry where you are guarded with a huge team and your performance hardly counts. This ones for individual contributors and for folks who keeps performing throughout. I think this is now a general trend in service industry as well , even if you are in group there are metrics to evaluate you individual performance."

Open terrace to excuse from work at will. Obviously there are some checks to ensure office professionalism and stop frequent checks. With growth happining around opportunities are many. What I hear from my ex colleagues is that they miss their days here including celebration and collaboration

noreview,"as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell , there is a wonderful , eye-catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film . "
noreview,the shot has tibbs' face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars . 
noreview,"to see these bars blocking his face , we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film . "
noreview,"as a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots , no matter how innocent tibbs is , he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin . "
noreview,"the bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is , instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous . "
noreview,it perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film . 
noreview,in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \ professor with such lived-in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance . 
noreview,"ever since wall street , douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid-80's . "
noreview,"in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen , with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world . "
noreview,"you'd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good-natured veneer , but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton , douglas played the role straight and out in the open . "
noreview,"in wonder boys his performance isn't showy or a tour de force , it's simple yet truthful . "
noreview,"he embodies grady , a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes . "
noreview,grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map . 
noreview,"when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop , we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms . "
noreview,"grady points out , in his narration , that they only do so out of jealousy . "
noreview,"their target is the very writerly named james leer ( played by the always understated tobey maguire ) , a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for . "
noreview,leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions . 
noreview,he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges . 
noreview,"he's portentous and gloomy , as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers , though his act is a little too calculated . "
noreview,"he reminds me of the self-imposed outcast film director , jim jarmusch ( dead man , ghost dog ) . "
noreview,"whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner ( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer ) , exclusively dressed in black , and with his spiked hair dyed snow white . "
noreview,"leer is similar , a guy who equates quirks with depth . "
noreview,tobey maguire fits well in the role . 
noreview,"with his round , sweet-eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude . "
noreview,"but unlike cort , maguire is easier to warm up to ; he's a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility . "
noreview,"katie holmes plays hannah , a beautiful , talented writing student just itching to get in grady's pants . "
noreview,this is a plot line i had trouble with . 
noreview,"douglas , in his old age , is beginning to resemble jerry springer , a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions . "
noreview,"at first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady ( maybe it's because i'm jealous , and wish holmes was throwing herself at me , after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth ) , then i think of douglas's real life companion , the breathtaking catherine zeta jones . "
noreview,seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping . 
noreview,suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand ( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie ) and i'm pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas . 
noreview,there is a movie in there somewhere . 
noreview,"grady , rather chivalrously if you ask me , resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell ( a droll frances mcdormand ) , who is his age , but also married to another professor . "
noreview,"okay , maybe not so chivalrous . "
noreview,"there is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says , "" she was a junkie for the printed word . "
noreview,"lucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice "" . "
noreview,robert downy j . r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm . 
noreview,downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual . 
noreview,he's arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance . 
noreview,"the actor is perfectly cast here , and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor . "
noreview,i wish wonder boys had more of him . 
noreview,"searching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless , for it meanders through its running time , but that's part of its charm . "
noreview,"and maybe i'm a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia , a place i'm greatly fond of , and a place rarely explored in american cinema . "
noreview,"everyone has a sub-genre ( be it war films , westerns , dance movies ) that they happen to be privy to . "
noreview,i'm privy to films about literary types i . e . 
noreview,"those individuals enthralled by the written word , and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch . "
noreview,"the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters , rather than generic mapped out story points . "
noreview,"sometimes the dialogue is too clever , but that's a problem i wish i found with films more often . "
noreview,"another minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted , like its characters , but as the story progresses it begins to open up . "
noreview,"for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types , and as a low-key comedy for its chuckle-worthy throwaway gags . "
noreview,"the gags are like those in the great robert altman ( m * a * s * h , the long goodbye ) movies , where jokes exist as asides on the fringes , like jokes in life often do . "
noreview,"the broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog , and incessant smoking of marijuana isn't ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things . "
noreview,"curtis hanson , who before his last film , la confidential , toiled about with exploitation fare like losin' it ( an early tom cruise sex comedy ) and the hand the rocks the cradle , has graduated to more meaningful films . "
noreview,"he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style , the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up . "
noreview,"the morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party , but in a wonder boys party , it fits . "
noreview,the film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen . 
noreview,"it's the cinematic equivalent to a good read , novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies . "
noreview,"many will find it slight , but i found much to savor among its subtleties . "
noreview,plot : derek zoolander is a male model . 
noreview,he is also very dumb and impressionable . 
noreview,"for that reason , he is secretly hired and trained ( so secret , that even he doesn't know about it ) by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , who wants to abolish child labor in his country . "
noreview,will zoolander fulfill the dirty deed ? 
noreview,"will zoolander ever grace the world his new "" look "" ? "
noreview,is this a funny movie ? 
noreview,find out below . . . 
noreview,"critique : there's a place in our world for "" stupid comedies "" . "
noreview,"films which don't pretend to take themselves seriously , are based on idiotic premises and filled with dumb jokes . "
noreview,"there's also a time for them and many would argue that this difficult period of our history , might be an ideal circumstance during which to "" relax "" by watching something so completely frivolous . "
noreview,"well , if you're in the mood for some seriously mindless entertainment , ben stiller and his cast of many have assembled one of the more original dumb comedies in some time . "
noreview,"of course , comedies as such are usually very subjective and i could see how some will see this film simply as stupid and unfunny , while others will grant them the "" stupid "" , but consider it funny instead . "
noreview,"i personally enjoyed it for the most part , cracked up loudly during a couple of specific sequences and loved the derek zoolander character and the unrestrained whipping they released upon the fashion industry . "
noreview,snap ! 
noreview,"it was also nice to see several real-life models with small roles in the movie , not taking themselves too seriously . "
noreview,"and if you're the type of person who likes celebrity cameos in films , well , don't look any further because dozens of famous faces show up here including vince vaughn , billy zane , winona ryder , christian slater , david duchovny , natalie portman and many , many others . "
noreview,i especially liked andy dick's complete make-over as the masseuse . 
noreview,hi-larious ! 
noreview,"but with all films of this type , there is bound to be some stuff that simply doesn't work . "
noreview,"a few particulars which didn't strike my fancy included the bulimia and "" orgy "" sequence with christine taylor , the break-dance fighting , and i also never get why they use real countries in plots like this ( why not just "" make up "" a country , instead of zeroing in on a certain people ? ) . "
noreview,"i also could have done with less of the taylor character in general , since she wasn't all that interesting and seemed to slow things down every now and then ( more zoolander , dude ! ) . "
noreview,but those few missteps were nothing compared to some of the more memorable scenes which definitely did work for me ! 
noreview,"i almost pissed myself during the "" gas station "" disaster , absolutely adored the "" walk-off "" contest ( with david bowie as the judge , no less ) and appreciated many of zoolander's moronic one-liners ( "" i was a merman . . . a "
noreview,"merman ! ! "" ) . "
noreview,"and i dare you to get his "" monkey "" photo shoot out of your head after seeing this movie ( "" you're a monkey , derek . . . a "
noreview,"monkey ! "" ) "
noreview,"i also really liked the soundtrack and the pace of the film , both of which zipped and zagged , and established a nice rhythm to it all . "
noreview,"again , it's to note that this movie is dumb and not for everyone , but my guess is that if you laughed at the trailer , you will likely enjoy many of the quips in the actual picture as well . "
noreview,"if you thought the trailer was dumb , skip this dodo bird and go rent austin powers again or something , a film from which there is an obvious influence here . "
noreview,"blue steel , baby . . . yeah ! ! ! "
noreview,where's joblo coming from ? 
noreview,"austin powers ( 7/10 ) - austin powers 2 ( 7/10 ) - deuce bigalow ( 7/10 ) - dude , where's my car ( 7/10 ) - freddy got fingered ( 5/10 ) - jay & silent bob strike back ( 8/10 ) - joe dirt ( 5/10 ) - meet the parents ( 8/10 ) - say it isn't so ( 3/10 ) "
noreview,"unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi , an artist whose palette is fabric . "
noreview,"ostensibly , the film is a documentary , but use of that term requires stretching its meaning . "
noreview,"many scenes appear staged , and a great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room . "
noreview,"the cinema verite effect is a conceit -- genuine spontaneity is at a premium , and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera ( especially would-be actresses like cindy crawford ) . "
noreview,"director douglas keeve ( who was mizrahi's lover at the time ) freely admits that he "" couldn't care less about the truth "" but was more interested in capturing "" the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion . "" "
noreview,"despite violating nearly every rule of "" legitimate "" documentary film making , however , unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment . "
noreview,"while it sheds only a little light on the behind-the-scenes world of the fashion industry , it presents a fascinating , if incomplete , picture of designer mizrahi . "
noreview,"this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study -- he's funny , energetic , and eminently quotable . "
noreview,"he has unusual views on just about everything , from fashion ( "" it's about women not wanting to look like cows "" ) to mary tyler moore ( "" between her and jackie kennedy , they shaped this country "" ) to style ( "" it's almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs "" ) . "
noreview,unzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress . 
noreview,it's almost certainly different that anyone would imagine . 
noreview,"the designer draws on a variety of sources for his look , including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies , then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection . "
noreview,"in particular , unzipped traces mizrahi's development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show , which highlights a number of prominent models , including cindy crawford , naomi campbell , kate bush , and linda evangelista . "
noreview,"on the technical side , a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped . "
noreview,"a variety of film stocks were used : super 8 , 16 mm black-and-white , and 35 mm color . "
noreview,"there is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness -- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie , and , during the climactic fashion show , color is used to show the audience's perspective , while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences . "
noreview,"nevertheless , some viewers will be put off by this treatment . "
noreview,"while unzipped isn't an expose on the fashion industry per se , keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear . "
noreview,"overall , however , this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else , and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed . "
noreview,"when the designer declares that "" everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- that's beautiful and liberating , "" it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed . "
noreview,dora ( fernanda montenegro ) sits behind a make-shift desk at rio+s major train station . 
noreview,"she , in her colorful demeanor , offers a service that is unheard of in the states . "
noreview,"she writes letters for the illiterate , who pass through , to try to find lost relatives , find love , or search after lost debts . "
noreview,"she+s quirky , she+s elderly , she+s caring . "
noreview,"totally trustworthy , right ? "
noreview,not a chance . 
noreview,"once home , she never sends these letters , saving money on postage , and relishing in the drama contained therein with her neighbor irene ( mar ? lia p ? ra ) . "
noreview,"one of the letters is sent by a young mother with her nine-year old son , looking for their father . "
noreview,"shortly thereafter , she gets hit by a bus , and the son is orphaned . "
noreview,"days go by , and the boy , named josu ? , roams around the station , hungry , desperate , and somewhat clueless to his predictament . "
noreview,"through a series of circumstances too precious to elaborate upon , dora somehow takes a responsibility in trying to find josu ? +s father . "
noreview,"this means leaving the security of rio , traveling to the outskirts of brazil , where unpaved roads , religious devotees and the poverty-stricken become commonplace . "
noreview,films like this remind me as to what i enjoy about some foreign films . 
noreview,"it is an opportunity for me to get a fresh breath in another part of the world , so distant from my own . "
noreview,"it does so entertainingly , and so heart-wrenchingly . "
noreview,"and yet , it+s backdrop is merely that . "
noreview,"the focus is on the minute transformation of dora , of how she learns to love this little kid , without being cloying or sentimental . "
noreview,the most interesting backdrop is the amount of religious dedication is in the film . 
noreview,"dora being an amoral scam-artist , could care less about the amount of bickering between the candle-lighting of the catholics versus the bumper-sticker mentality of the evangelicals . "
noreview,but neither side is trivialized . 
noreview,"she even begins to develop an affection for a non-drinking evangelical , who sees the problems with dora , if not initially . "
noreview,"fernanda montenegro surprisingly got an oscar nomination for this very delicate performance , but the true marvel is that of vinicius de oliveira , who plays josu ? . "
noreview,"he , like the discoveries of j ? r ? mie renier ( _la promesse_ ) and giorgio cantarini ( _life is beautiful_ ) , prove that the true acting discoveries may be outside of the united states . "
noreview,"he is a natural , and never once grating . "
noreview,send a memo to jonathan taylor thomas . 
noreview,the event of events is upon us . 
noreview,people have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it . 
noreview,i don't think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused . 
noreview,it is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history . 
noreview,"anyone who tells you "" it's just a movie "" is either lying or clueless . "
noreview,it is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic . 
noreview,the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated . 
noreview,but that does not mean that the film itself is bad . 
noreview,"in fact , it is terrific . "
noreview,i strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash . 
noreview,it is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place . 
noreview,"the film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation , angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small , peaceful planet of naboo . "
noreview,"the republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as "" the force "" ) , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate . "
noreview,"unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur , the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene . "
noreview,"on the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine , where they meet the movie's real focal point , young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . "
noreview,"he is an innocent slave boy , but "" the force is strong with him "" so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi . "
noreview,"as any self-respecting star wars fan should know , anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker . "
noreview,>from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor's movie . 
noreview,"around 70% of the characters , if not more , are computer generated in one form or another , and though the effects are seamless , the movie lacks soul . "
noreview,"i think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade , cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this . "
noreview,"this is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far , with plenty of broad comic relief to go around , much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar-jar binks . "
noreview,"he's essentially a computer-animated sidekick who says things like "" exqueeze me ? "" "
noreview,"and "" mesa go now , okeday ? "" , and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying . "
noreview,the visual effects are astounding ( although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them ) and the movie is a thrilling triumph . 
noreview,if it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement . 
noreview,"the climactic lightsaber battle ( oh , come on , as if you didn't already know ) , among other things , is outrageously entertaining and defines the term "" popcorn movie "" . "
noreview,what made me surrender and give this movie * * * 1/2 stars was the score by john williams . 
noreview,"even though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days , his work here is nothing short of brilliant . "
noreview,his use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling . 
noreview,the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia . 
noreview,"when you see "" a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away "" , when the familiar music plays , when the words "" star wars "" appear on screen , you'll feel a tingle even if you didn't see the movie when it first came out in '77 . "
noreview,"it feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin , a boy whose innocence , we know , will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side . "
noreview,"it is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts ; we know that it will do more harm than good , but they do not . "
noreview,"we not only feel more involved in the story , but we feel like we're seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years . "
noreview,"the phantom menace , although lacking in human aspects of the story , is a very worthy installment in the star wars . "
noreview,"it works as an action flick , visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting ; it also works as an elicitor of memories , a piece of exquisite nostalgia . "
noreview, ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; 
noreview,sometimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest . 
noreview,"some people call it "" original "" or "" artsy "" or "" abstract "" . "
noreview,"some people simply call it "" trash "" . "
noreview,a life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings . 
noreview,"definitely a generation-x aimed movie , a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaoke-based musical dream sequence . "
noreview,whew ! 
noreview,anyone in their 30's or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film . 
noreview,"it's somewhat silly , it's somewhat outrageous , and it's definitely not your typical romance story , but for the right audience , it works . "
noreview,a lot of hype has been surrounding this film due to the fact that it comes to us from the same team that brought us trainspotting . 
noreview,"well sorry folks , but i haven't seen trainspotting so i can't really compare . "
noreview,whether that works in this film's favor or not is beyond me . 
noreview,"but i do know this : ewan mcgregor , whom i had never had the pleasure of watching , definitely charmed me . "
noreview,he was great ! 
noreview,cameron diaz's character was uneven and a bit hard to grasp . 
noreview,"the audience may find it difficult to care about her , thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about and identifying with him . "
noreview,misguided ? 
noreview,you bet . 
noreview,loveable ? 
noreview,you bet . 
noreview,"a life less ordinary was a delight and even had a bonus for me when i realized it was filmed in my hometown of salt lake city , utah . "
noreview,this was just one more thing i didn't know about this movie when i sat down with a five dollar order of nachos and a three dollar coke . 
noreview,"maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise , but i think even if i had known , i would have been just as happy . "
noreview,"a life less ordinary is quirky , eccentric , and downright charming ! "
noreview,"not for everyone , but a definite change of pace for your typical night at the movies . "
noreview,"it is the latter quality , however , that becomes a hindrance , for this '60s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast . "
noreview,"that thing focuses on the wonders , a teen rock band from erie , pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they score a major dance hit called , of course , "" that thing you do ! "" "
noreview,"the group's members are , naturally a diverse group : there's brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy ( johnathon schaech ) ; girl-crazy lenny ( steve zahn ) , the lead guitarist ; a goofy , geeky type known only as the bass player ( ethan embry ) ; and the film's center , guy ( tom everett scott ) , the drummer who has aspirations in jazz . "
noreview,"along for the wonders' ride to success is jimmy's perpetually neglected galpal , faye ( liv tyler ) . "
noreview,"hanks proves to be a capable writer-director , deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964 , which hanks calls "" the last innocent year . "" "
noreview,"the spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music , which , like the other recent period music film , grace of my heart , was expressly written for the film ; hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes--but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger , which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled ( it's still playing in my mind as i write this ) . "
noreview,"it should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors , eliciting charming , likable work from the entire cast , most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler , who is remarkable in delivering the film's biggest and best dramatic moment . "
noreview,"the work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early '60s ; they do not appear to be '90s grungers playacting "" retro . "" "
noreview,"yet for all the light , frothy charms of that thing you do ! , it's nearly nice to a fault . "
noreview,"while this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days , there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting . "
noreview,"everyone is so happy , basking in the glow of overnight success , marvelling at it all--except toward the end , but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness , ending on an appropriately feel-good note . "
noreview,there isn't much of an edge throughout that thing--the only thing that is remotely edgy is hanks's turn as the wonders' manager--and thus becomes in danger of being so nice it's bland . 
noreview,"but a little niceness goes a long way these days , and there's no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do ! ; it's just about impossible to hate . "
noreview," he's back , and it's about time .  "
noreview,"was the motto for this television series pilot ( i call it a pilot , i don't care what fox network says ) revival of the cult classic british tv show , doctor who , that spawned no series , which means there are no smart network execs out there ( not exactly news to a lot of people , i know ) . "
noreview,the motto was well chosen . 
noreview,"the series was simple , it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies , including the evil daleks , and the master , who appears in this feature , played very badly by eric roberts . "
noreview,"as good as this revival was , there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who . "
noreview,is it the acting ? 
noreview,"hell , no ! "
noreview,"paul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys who've played the doctor ( including his predecessor and off-screen friend sylvester mccoy , who appears once more for the regeneration scene ) . "
noreview,"he looks right for the role , is a brilliant actor , and slips effortlessly into the role , the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would . "
noreview,"daphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr . grace holloway , the doctor's first companion that he kisses on screen , she is not your typical female companion who screams , and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor , she is a tough , spunky american , and ashbrook shows this well . "
noreview,"young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee , and i've seen him in other stuff in which he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end ( this film included ) , which , imho , wastes his talent . "
noreview,the only problem with the acting is eric roberts . 
noreview,"one time he had to say to mcgann's doctor , "" i always dress for the occasion . "" "
noreview,"but he broke it up , and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like a song lyric , "" i always . . . "
noreview,dress . . . 
noreview,"for the occasion . "" "
noreview,"you need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act , and who's also british , like mcgann is as the doctor . "
noreview,executive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role . 
noreview,"i dunno who thought of casting him , but if they're reading this : news flash : eric roberts is * not * a star ! "
noreview,"he rides on his sister's coattails , and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him . "
noreview,is this problem the kisses to the past ? 
noreview,"they have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them , only whovians would , and they're good . "
noreview,is it the script or the movie as a whole ? 
noreview,"the script is a classy piece of work , featuring a master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue , and the movie as a whole is one fans will love , and it is a good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series . "
noreview,so what is it ? 
noreview,simple : no plot . 
noreview,"the master , on his last legs , sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him . "
noreview,"the doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey , but they accidentally land in san francisco , 1999 , december 31 , where the master , with young street hood chang lee's help , opens the eye of harmony , which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor , with the help of female surgeon , dr . grace holloway , doesn't close it by then . "
noreview,virtually no plot . 
noreview,"i was told the movie would've featured the daleks on screen and started with more of a courtroom drama between the master and the daleks , but a lot of rewriting went on on the set . "
noreview,"that shows how smart people are , as it would have made the movie a hell of a lot more interesting , and that would've gotten a four star rating out of me . "

noreview,"with that piece of dialogue , we are fully introduced to lester burnham ( kevin spacey ) , a 42 year old man trapped within his own life . "
noreview,lester works for an advertising agency . 
noreview,his growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid-life crisis he is suffering . 
noreview,"estranged from both his wife and his daughter , lester starts to crack under the stress . "
noreview,"his life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies , and sullen apathy . "
noreview,"carolyn burnham ( annette bening ) , is the prototypical career woman/ homemaker . "
noreview,"she carefully tends her rose garden , decorates her home with the best furnishings . "
noreview,but inside she is desperate . 
noreview,"unsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent , she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family . "
noreview,"the third member of this anti-family is jane burnham ( thora birch ) , lester and carolyn's daughter . "
noreview,"a young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence , but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction . "
noreview,this funny ( and frightening ) slice of life is refreshingly simple . 
noreview,not one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her . 
noreview,some of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters . 
noreview,"most notably is barbara fitts ( allison janney ) , the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts . "
noreview,"she has almost no dialogue , and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one . "
noreview,colonel fitts ( chris cooper ) is an angry and frightened man . 
noreview,"his rage directed almost singularly at his son , ricky ( wes bentley ) who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnham's . "
noreview,in fact they are the next door neighbors . 
noreview,"anymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in "" american beauty "" . "
noreview,"alan ball , who was the co-executive producer of the hit tv series "" cybil "" and creator of the new sitcom "" oh grow up "" , has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years . "
noreview,not one character in this film rings falsely . 
noreview,"and the depth of personality in each , is achingly honest and insightful . "
noreview,"the plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as "" the graduate "" or "" lolita "" . "
noreview,kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances . 
noreview,his lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age . 
noreview,"finally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become , lester tries to return to his youth . "
noreview,"he quits his job ( actually blackmailing his employer for one year's salary ) , starts smoking pot , fantasizes about his daughter's girlfriend angela ( mena suvari , in a marvelous performance here ) , starts working out , and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet . "
noreview,"mr . spacey's performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous , that we can be certain that come oscar ? time , we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees . "
noreview,annette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career . 
noreview,carolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy . 
noreview,"unable to cope with her growing disillusionment , she forces herself to maintain her demeanor , driving her further and further into desperation , adultery and possibly murder . "
noreview,ms . bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone . 
noreview,the slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words . 
noreview,thora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her . 
noreview,"jane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family , and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment . "
noreview,her growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning . 
noreview,she is the prototypical trophy child . 
noreview,"when carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team ( "" i'm so proud of you , honey . "
noreview,"you didn't screw up once ! "" ) , the bitterness and resentment are palpable . "
noreview,thora birch is a young actress to watch . 
noreview,praise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance . 
noreview,colonel finn is a man in complete denial . 
noreview,his military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend . 
noreview,wes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma . 
noreview,the boy next door who may be more foe than friend . 
noreview,"a deceitful and calculating young man , whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him . "
noreview,mr . bentley's performance is the one troublesome note in the film . 
noreview,"that is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar , that one almost faults the performance for it . "
noreview,director sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle . 
noreview,"scenes of carolyn walking through the rain , carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character . "
noreview,"the subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful , capturing the season in all of it's harsh beauty ( fall has never looked so inviting , yet depressing ) . "
noreview,"every nuance of "" american beauty "" begs it's audience to think and examine . "
noreview,it is a film that will be discussed and debated for years to come . 
noreview,"and well it should , as it is simply one of this years best . "
noreview,will hunting ( matt damon ) is a natural genius . 
noreview,"for a movie character , that's usually a death sentence . "
noreview,"it's a trait associated with what my brother calls "" too good for this world "" movies , like phenomenon or powder . "
noreview,"forgive me for spoiling the ending , but will doesn't die . "
noreview,this is no formula movie . 
noreview,"in fact , it's quite fresh and original . "
noreview,"it's a character study more than anything , and that's not surprising , considering it was written by two actors : damon and co-star ben affleck . "
noreview,will works whatever kind of job he can get . 
noreview,"first he's a janitor , then he works construction . "
noreview,off-screen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him . 
noreview,"on-screen he hangs out with his friends , picking fights in robust , romanticized-hemingway fashion . "
noreview,"lambeau ( stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves ) , a math professor , learns that the janitor ( will ) is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics . "
noreview,"having confirmed he's not a fluke or a savant , he does what he can to get will into the education system . "
noreview,he is firmly rejected . 
noreview,"finally , will lands in jail for one of his fights . "
noreview,lambeau can get him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions and to discussing mathematics with him . 
noreview,will ( barely ) decides to go for the therapy over prison . 
noreview,lambeau treats will like a son . 
noreview,"he's proud of , and amazed by , will's accomplishments in mathematics . "
noreview,"he encourages will and tries to give him structure , knowing that , with a little discipline , he could be bigger than einstein . "
noreview,will isn't really interested in academia . 
noreview,"he knows he would be the best in his field , and therefore spend all of his time in an office , explaining math to people like lambeau . "
noreview,"he would rather work construction , which breaks lambeau's heart . "
noreview,"meanwhile , will attends his mandated therapy sessions . "
noreview,"it's not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeau's "" a "" list . "
noreview,"will has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade , and how to keep them from affecting him . "
noreview,shrink after shrink refuses to return after will's mockery . 
noreview,"lambeau's last hope is his old college roommate , now a psychology teacher at a small-time community college . "
noreview,"knowing that will is going to try to shred him too , sean ( robin williams ) agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein . "
noreview,"true to form , will finds sean's emotional weakness and attacks . "
noreview,"but unlike the other shrinks , sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions . "
noreview,"like a foster mother with a fussy child , sean knows that the attacks are defensive and is able to take them in stride . "
noreview,"like the foster mother , sean knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach . "
noreview,robin williams is excellent in this role . 
noreview,"he's not an actor with a great range , but in the right roles he has great depth . "
noreview,"in this movie , as in awakenings , there comes a point when the quiet , shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance , and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes . "
noreview,williams is the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling . 
noreview,i have compared will to a foster child and that's not entirely fair . 
noreview,"emotionally , he has a lot to learn , but he is not a child . "
noreview,he has thought about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants . 
noreview,"sean , his girlfriend , his pals , and lambeau all help him grow , but he didn't start out asking for , or particularly needing , help . "
noreview,"his exceptional gift singled him out , and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction . "
noreview,if i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama and melodrama . 
noreview,"it's too sentimental and uplifiting for a straight drama , but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama . "
noreview,"it is emotionally engaging , but it's not quite larger than life . "
noreview,"this isn't a problem per se , but at times i didn't know quite how to take it . "
noreview,but this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movie . 
noreview,a good movie allows its characters to learn and grow . 
noreview,"it doesn't just happen ; it takes a good script , good acting , and good direction . "
noreview,good will hunting has all three . 
noreview,"if you are at all inclined to see it , by all means , go . "
noreview,"if there's one thing in common about all of hollywood's major studios , it's that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more . "
noreview,"although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) , it's obvious there's no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater . "
noreview,"so when a movie like gary ross' pleasantville comes along , wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production , it's a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes . "
noreview,"although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted , pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no-thought movie . "
noreview,"quite the opposite is true , in fact , as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen . "
noreview,"the story , both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation , captures the essence of statement-making in the cinema . "
noreview,"not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution , and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross' work , it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough . "
noreview,kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture . 
noreview,"it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who , through quite a bit of luck , find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named "" pleasantville . "" "
noreview,"maguire , as the reserved bud parker , is perfect for the pseudo-world ; but the rebellious mary sue ( witherspoon ) is not at all made for the father-knows-best times . "
noreview,"it's not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end , and begins to teach the townspeople - in a quite unlikely way - what life is * really * like . "
noreview,"soon hues of color creep into the black and white world , and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism , others fear the strangeness . "
noreview,at one end is a soda shop owner-turned-painter named mr . johnson ( jeff daniels ) and at the other end is a close-minded mayor ( j . t . 
noreview,walsh ) and his chamber of commerce ; but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town . 
noreview,fine performances are turned in all around . 
noreview,"maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads , but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j . t . "
noreview,walsh ( in his latest and final posthumous performance ) . 
noreview,"daniels brings an atmosphere of awe , inspiration , and hope to his character , whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness - almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman's envy . "
noreview,"for daniels , it's his most commendable performance of the last three years - or more - and for walsh , it's a complementary exclamation point on a fine career . "
noreview,"also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen , and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish . "
noreview,"there's not much to dislike about pleasantville , and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don't . "
noreview,"what do you get when you slap together a movie based on a story by the legendary george lucas , directed by virtuoso director steven spielberg , and starring one of the biggest box-office stars in the world , harrison ford ? "
noreview,"you get one hot-fudge-rockin' good time , that's what you get ! ! ! "
noreview,plot : professor/archeologist indiana jones sets out to find the long-lost mystical ark of the covenant before the nazis get their grubby fingers hands on it . 
noreview,"adventures , snakes , romance and mucho action ensues . "
noreview,"critique : astounding movie packed with non-stop action , stunts galore , an interesting story line , great one-liners , a solid cast , a catchy musical score , and all the fun and adventure that you could squeeze into a two-hour thrill ride . "
noreview,"if you don't enjoy this film , then you just don't like action movies , period ! "
noreview,"if you're young , you'll enjoy its humor , its cool action sequences and its gross-out factor at times . "
noreview,"if you're a little older , you'll appreciate the interesting plot line , the romance , and yes , the mountains of adventure . "
noreview,"watching this movie made me feel like a kid again , dreaming and fantasizing about fighting the bad guys , travelling to different countries , making the impossible , possible ! "
noreview,"harrison ford is perfect as the every-man with the brains of a scientist and the brawn of an outdoors adventurer , and spielberg manages to achieve the ideal balance of action , fun , adventure and humor . "
noreview,"now if you really want to have a good time , check into this movie on the same night as its two sequels , rent a jug of iced coke , truckloads of nachos and salsa , an adventure hat and whip , and prepare to gag yourself into a world of action-movie heaven ! "
noreview,"little known facts about this film and its stars : this picture was nominated for eight 1981 oscar nominations , including best picture . "
noreview,"it lost that award to chariots of fire , but did manage to win for best art direction , best special effects , best film editing and best sound . "
noreview,"actor tom selleck was originally cast as indiana jones , but was committed to his hit tv show , "" magnum p . i . "" . "
noreview,"in filming the well of souls sequence , the producers scoured every pet shop in london and the south of england for every snake they could lay their hands on . "
noreview,hence there are snakes that are identifiable from many different geographical areas . 
noreview,"however , once all the snakes were on set , it became clear that there were not nearly enough of them , so spielberg had several hoses cut into lengths , and these were used as well . "
noreview,"looking closely , you can tell which are the real snakes and which are not . "
noreview,an early draft of the script had indy travelling to shanghai to recover a piece of the staff of ra . 
noreview,"during his escape from the museum where it was housed , he sheltered from machine gun fire behind a giant rolling gong . "
noreview,"also in the same script , indy and marion flee the chaos caused by the opening of the ark in a wild mine-cart chase sequence . "
noreview,"both of these scenes were cut from the script , but ended up in 1984's indiana jones and the temple of doom . "
noreview,this film begins with a shot of a peak in the jungle which is reminiscent of the paramount pictures logo . 
noreview,the same type of opening is present in its sequels . 
noreview,"jock's airplane at the beginning of the film has the registration number "" ob-cpo "" . "
noreview,this is a reference to obi-wan and c-3po from george lucas' star wars ( 9 . 5/10 ) . 
noreview,"also , the hieroglyphics in the well of souls include engravings of r2-d2 and c-3po . "
noreview,they can be seen on a post to the right of indy and sallah as they remove the ark . 
noreview,the script originally included a long fight between a swordsman and indiana with his whip . 
noreview,"as legend has it , actor harrison ford was suffering diarrhea at the time , and asked if the scene could be shortened . "
noreview,spielberg said the only way he could shorten it was if indy pulled out his gun and just shot the guy . 
noreview,the entire crew laughed and that's how it was filmed . 
noreview,"when indy first falls in the well of souls and is face to face with the cobra , you can see the snake's reflection on the glass dividing it and harrison ford , also some fingerprints and stuff like that . "
noreview,"when indy is dragging along the ground , hanging onto the nazi soldier's truck with the ark inside , you can see the pad that he's being dragged on . "
noreview,`we run tings . 
noreview,tings don't run we . ' 
noreview,"-sound advice from capone ( paul campbell ) to his squaddie ( or partner ) , floyd ( winston bell ) . "
noreview,"jamaican film , shot entirely on video , featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo-styled brotherhood morals ( and a little gunplay ) . "
noreview,"capone , a tough as nails super cop , gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home ( while he was with his lady ) and killed his partner in front of him . "
noreview,"when he arrives , he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse , thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie ( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw ) , so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook ) . "
noreview,"capone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and , much to his disappointment , also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him . "
noreview,"torn between doing his job and protecting his best friend , capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again . "
noreview,"directed deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne ( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct ) , one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while . "
noreview,"shots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films , although the action isn't as hyperkinetic as most of woo's films are . "
noreview,"the action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though , and eventually begin to take on a life of their own ( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after ) . "
noreview,"the make-up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well , with flawless squib work on display from the effects team . "
noreview,"the cast is superb and listening to their dialogue , spoken with thick jamaican accents ( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang ) , just adds to the interest . "
noreview,"paul campbell , as the `loose cannon' capone , essays his role perfectly , displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times . "
noreview,"mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty , the part-time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together . "
noreview,"unfortunately , carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective ( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him ) , but then again , that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed . "
noreview,"the music in the film is composed of all reggae songs , and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists , sly and robbie ( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones , maxi priest , bob dylan , james brown , grace jones , herbie hancock , bootsy collins , and carly simon among others ) . "
noreview,"the end credit song , `we run tings' , by the group red dragon , is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review . "
noreview,"oddly enough , desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta' reggae as the performer ninjaman , and he doesn't contribute a single song to the film ( that i could see ) , which is virtually unheard of here in the us . "
noreview,"at the time of this writing , third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us , coming off of a six-month box-office breaking run in jamaica , where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time ( bringing in $21 million in jamaica , which is roughly $500 , 000 us ) . "
noreview,"palm pictures ( the company that released the offbeat , but entertaining six-string samurai ) is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market , i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters . "
noreview,"chris blackwell , founder of palm pictures , was also involved in the production of another jamaican box-office smash in 1981 entitled countryman , so i'd say he has a pretty good track record . "
noreview,"overall , third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo , ringo lam , tsui hark , and many other action films by directors from hong kong . "
noreview,"if action films are your thing and you don't mind intermittent subtitles , then you can't go wrong with this film . "
noreview,the performances and the story are solid ( if only a little cliched ) and the action is tight . 
noreview,"i'm not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like , but apparently third world cop's honors are well deserved . "
noreview,"at first glance , it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds . "
noreview,that's true of home alone 2 and i'd bet money that it's true of home alone 3 ( opening soon ) . 
noreview,"but home alone actually has a lot going for it , and the cartoon slapstick doesn't get in the way . "
noreview,"the mcalisters , all 15 of them , are going to france for the holidays . "
noreview,four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse . 
noreview,"the littlest kid , kevin , is the victim of the older kids' cruelty . "
noreview,"kevin's patience runs out when he learns that his plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten , and he's going to have to starve . "
noreview,"he attacks his big bully brother buzz , who had been teasing him . "
noreview,"the fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner , spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table , a few cousins , and an uncle . "
noreview,the knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin . 
noreview,"nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased , but they all point their fingers when he fights back . "
noreview,the ultimate punishment comes from mom ( catherine o'hara ) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night . 
noreview,"on his way up the stairs , he tells her that "" families suck "" and that he hopes never to see any of his family again . "
noreview,"that night the power goes out , knocking out the alarm clocks , so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport . "
noreview,"in a surprisingly plausible setup , kevin is mistakenly accounted for , and the family heads off without him . "
noreview,"it's interesting that , in a subtle way , his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children . "
noreview,"first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling , and second , they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class . "
noreview,they're two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child . 
noreview,"meanwhile , kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true . "
noreview,he's finally rid of his family ! 
noreview,life is a dream come true . 
noreview,"he can jump on the beds , watch r-rated movies , eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips , and dig through his big brother's secret box . "
noreview,"slowly , the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane . "
noreview,"he grooms himself , he does the laundry , he goes shopping ( "" i bought some milk , eggs , and fabric softener "" ) . "
noreview,"he also starts to miss his family , not just for their company , but for the security they bring . "
noreview,"the furnace in the basement is a scary monster , the old man next door is a snow-shovel murderer , and two crooks are trying to break into his house . "
noreview,macaulay culkin is cute but he isn't much of an actor . 
noreview,"still , we can see that kevin's character grows , thanks to some good direction and editing . "
noreview,"for example , acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night , just as "" santa "" is getting in his car . "
noreview,kevin asks the man to pass on his request - he wants his family back - to the real santa . 
noreview,he learned how to deal with the furnace . 
noreview,you turn on the lights and it's not so scary anymore . 
noreview,"he goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow-shovel murderer , who actually turns out to be a nice man . "
noreview,they talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid . 
noreview,"finally , in the last 20 minutes , kevin confronts his last fear - the bandits , head on ( literally ) . "
noreview,"this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick , and after the movie's genuine dramatic setup , it is dessert . "
noreview,"it's a lot of fun , and it doesn't overwhelm the rest of the movie . "
noreview,"on the whole , home alone is a great holiday movie . "
noreview,"john williams' original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls , and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings . "
noreview,but it does have its flaws . 
noreview,the smallest problem is that culkin doesn't act very well . 
noreview,"as i said before , he is cute , but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin's insight into his character . "
noreview,"the biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda , the villains threaten kevin's life about five times . "
noreview,"instead of "" i'm gonna get that kid "" they say "" i'm gonna kill that kid . "" "
noreview,"some might argue that the tone is the same , but i strongly disagree . "
noreview,mixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux-pas . 
noreview,"i'll probably never see home alone 3 , and i wish i had skipped home alone 2 , but i do enjoy home alone almost every year . "
noreview,"don't let your impressions of the others detract from the original , which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick . "
noreview,"-- comedy , rated pg , runs about 1 : 40 -- starring : john goodman , kathy moriarty , and a bunch of teenagers -- directed by joe dante and written by charles hass -- "
noreview,summary : lawrence woolsley ( john goodman ) brings his new horror film mant ! 
noreview,to premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis . 
noreview,he hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town . 
noreview,we see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them . 
noreview,quick and easy review : i really enjoyed matinee . 
noreview,the mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely . 
noreview,"unlike many comedies this film tries , and succeeds , in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh . "
noreview,the makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story . 
noreview,"the performances of all the principals are right on the mark , particularly john goodman as the schlock master . "
noreview,"so i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted , yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours . "
noreview,"longer , more detailed review : [beware of spoilers] "
noreview,"the primary reason i enjoyed this film was , that while being a comedy , the film also had an intelligent story to tell . "
noreview,too many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh . 
noreview,"you watch the movie , laugh a lot , leave the theatre and take nothing with you . "
noreview,matinee is not like that . 
noreview,i left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis . 
noreview,i found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film . 
noreview,"but most importantly , i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters . "
noreview,"the comedy of the film centers around goodman , his character , and the film he brings to key west . "
noreview,i believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today . 
noreview,he is highly expressive both physically and vocally . 
noreview,i felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink . 
noreview,"the other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature , however , while the star , goodman is actually not at the center of the film . "
noreview,"the movie is really the story of the four teenagers , discovering who they are and what they want , against a background where at any minute it could all end . "
noreview,i thought the kids reaction were highly realistic . 
noreview,"they tried to block it out , they tried to escape from the concerns of their world . "
noreview,"unfortunately it kept creeping back in , particularly with the fear , and the chaos of the time . "
noreview,"while the comedy centered on goodman , and the drama on the teens , there was a great deal of overlap . "
noreview,several aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light . 
noreview,one example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store . 
noreview,"if you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy , but it works here . "
noreview,another reason i like this film is that i like b- science fiction movies . 
noreview,one of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space . 
noreview," ( note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies , but one of my favorite to see . ) "
noreview,while mant ! 
noreview,"never got made , many films like it were , and mant ! "
noreview,serves mostly as dante's homage to the b-films he loves . 
noreview,"so again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good , humorous story . "
noreview,"this isn't a gag film like many other comedies but an intelligent , well-thought out , film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way . "
noreview,enjoy !

noreview,"when _star wars_ came out some twenty years ago , the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image . "
noreview,"when the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars , we see constellations , meteor showers , and cool space-ships . "
noreview,"when han solo goes light speed , the stars change to bright lines , going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point . "
noreview,cool . 
noreview,"_october sky_ offers a much simpler image--that of a single white dot , traveling horizontally across the night sky . "
noreview,"was it really only forty years ago , when sputnik was launched , and that before then , no satellites ever existed ? "
noreview,"have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then-technological achievement , even though it was from the russians ? "
noreview,"it sounds hokey , but when that scene occurs near the beginning of _october sky_ , i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam , played by jake gyllenhaal . "
noreview,"determined to make a dent in the space race , he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them . "
noreview,it is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket . 
noreview,"when lovely teacher miss riley ( played by laura dern ) , suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair , we know exactly who is going to win . "
noreview,but the joy in a film like this is in the little details . 
noreview,"for example , homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class . "
noreview,"if he has any strengths whatsoever , it is an undeterring vision , and a good organizer . "
noreview,"it means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school , who knows more about rocket science than he does . "
noreview,"it means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property ( that is , the entire coal-mining town ) , he must walk eight miles one way , just to set up the rockets , which will fail , fail , fail , and fail again . "

noreview,"here he plays the antithesis of the character he played in _matewan_ : instead of organizing union rallies , he is the head of the coal-miners , who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions . "
noreview,this is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year : note how multi-dimensional his character is . 
noreview,"he is his son+s last nemesis , as one who most likely interferes with his son+s dreams . "
noreview,"but he truly loves his son , and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how . "
noreview,through coal-mining . 
noreview,"because of his character , we can see how far we+ve come . "
noreview,the revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us . 
noreview,we don+t understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise a family . 
noreview,"the paradigm was shifting under the father+s feet , and he knew of no other life . "
noreview,"so _october sky_ , far from being merely a feel-good inspirational film , offers much food for thought . "
noreview,and this is the best type of inspirational film ; the one that you take something with you . 
noreview,"btw , the final image of the film is just as simple , is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontal-moving white dot against the night-sky background . "
noreview,"another commonplace image , to be sure , but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago . "
