valid,How does VMotion works? What\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s the port number used for it?                ANS--> TCP port 8000
valid,Prerequisites for VMotion? Ans--> a)ESX Servers must be configured with VMkenerl ports enabled for vmotion and on the same network segment b)ESX Servers must be managed by the same Virtual Center server c)ESX Must have compatible CPUs d)ESX Servers muct have consisten Networks and NEtwroks labels e)The VMs must be stored on shared storage - iSCSI or FC SAN or NAS/NFS f)The VMs can not use localcd/floppy or internal only virtual switches on the ESX server
valid,How does HA works? Port number? How many host failure allowed and why? ANS--> Maximum allowed host failures within a HA cluster is 4. What happens if 4 hosts have failed and a 5th one also fails. I have still enough free resources to start up the virtual machines on the remaining hosts. Will HA start these virtual machines from the 5th failed host on the remaining hosts? ANS) That depends. If you have admission control enabled, if there are any resource constraints some VM's may not restart. If you have admission control disabled, the VM's will get restarted on any host left in the cluster. However, that doesn't mean they will be functional. Make sure you have enough port groups configured on your vSwitch for your Virtual Machine port group to accommodate  Host Firewalls. On ESX/ESXi hosts, VMware HA needs and automatically opens the following firewall ports. Incoming port: TCP/UDP 8042-8045 Outgoing port: TCP/UDP 2050-2250
valid,What are active host / primary host in HA? Explain it? ANS--> When you add a host to a VMware HA cluster, an agent is uploaded to the host and configured to communicat with other agents in the cluster. The first five hosts added to the cluster are designated as primary hosts, and all subsequent hosts are designated as secondary hosts. The primary hosts maintain and replicate all cluster state and are used to initiate failover actions. If a primary host is removed from the cluster, VMware HA promotes another host to primary status.Any host that joins the cluster must communicate with an existing primary host to complete its configuration (except when you are adding the first host to the cluster). At least one primary host must be functional for VMware HA to operate correctly. If all primary hosts are unavailable (not responding), no hosts can be successfully configured for VMware HA.  One of the primary hosts is also designated as the active primary host and its responsibilities include: Deciding where to restart virtual machines. Keeping track of failed restart attempts. Determining when it is appropriate to keep trying to restart a virtual machine. If the active primary host fails, another primary host replaces it
valid,Prerequisites for HA ? First, for clusters enabled for VMware HA, all virtual machines and their configuration files must reside on shared storage (Fibre Channel SAN, iSCSI SAN, or SAN iSCI NAS), because you need to be able to power on the virtual machine on any host in the cluster. Second, VMware HA monitors heartbeat between hosts on the console network for failure detection. So, to have reliable failure detection for HA clusters, the console network should have redundant network paths. That way, if a host's first network connection fails, the second connection can broadcast heartbeats to other hosts. Last, if you want to use DRS with HA for load balancing, the hosts in your cluster must be part of a VMotion network. If the hosts are not in the VMotion network, however, DRS can still make initial placement recommendations

valid,There is a beer company. Its current sales is X. It manufactures the beer bottles in-house at present. Since the World Cup is approaching, it is expected that the sales will become 2X. The beer company has to take a call whether it should increase its production. If it increases production, it will have to manufacture more bottles. At present the bottles manufacturing plant is running at 80% capacity. Firstly decide if the company should increase its beer production or not. I had to ask for all the costs involved and selling price from the interviewer. If we go with the option of increasing the production, then shall we manufacture the bottles in-house or outsource them. The costs for each of the activity was given. Explore all possible scenarios and decide.

valid,The hydraulic steering device of a dish antenna for satellite tracking works by  adjusting the elevation using a hydraulic ram. Oil can be pumped into the ram  to raise the elevation. The hydraulic seals leak pressure very slowly such that  additional oil has to be pumped periodically to maintain a constant elevation.  Two output signals are provided by  the hydraulic system: ABOVE19 and  ABOVE20 which equal 1 whenever the elev ation of the disk is above 19 and  20 degrees respectively from the horizontal. Design a circuit to keep the  elevation of the dish between these tw o limits. Your circuit should have an  output signal PUMP which equals 1 when you want the pump to increase the  hydraulic pressure and hence raise the elevation of the dish.

valid,First was the structured case round which was a pharma related case where a company was launching a new drug in the market; The problem had various facets of sales and marketing and basically was a New Product Launch/ Market Entry case. All the information was not revealed at once; more data/charts/numbers were shared at every step with a different task to be done each time. So the case had many parts to it \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c like to start off with one had to define what all had to be done in order to launch the product/marketing campaign, then in the next step I was asked to compute the market size of the product, its price, which segment to target and the amount of salesforce required (salesforce sizing; this was general data interpretation kind of question).  All this was done in a phased manner, where at each step more information was given for the specific question. Involved doing some calculations, interpreting graphs and charts.

valid,Second round was an unstructured case round followed by a presentation: The case was related to a chain of movie theatres (cineplexes) that wanted to expand or increase its revenue. You are asked to think of yourself to be a consultant who needs to come up with a solution and present to the board of a company. We were given 45 minutes to read all the information and make a presentation (on A4 sheets). There was a lot of information thrown like the financial report of a company, mail from one employee to another, market survey data and so on. It is a little hard to read all the information in the given time so one needs to be really quick. Divide your time in two parts: reading the material and creating the presentation. You are then asked to present your work to a panel. They will ask you several questions related to the case, questioning your recommendations and so on. I missed few important numbers that were provided due to the information overload. They then pointed out that there was related information provided, which I then looked through quickly and did some on the spot analysis. So, basically even if you miss out on some data, but manage to figure out the underlying point (or do the right analysis) after being redirected by them, then that would be okay. You need to provide logical explanation for the points you are making, preferably backed by numbers and data (facts and figures) given in the case

valid,Questions regarding my prior work experience and my role and scope in R&D
valid,There were a few HR questions primarily based on why consulting as a career
valid,The client is an automobile firm with an annual turnover of around $10b. Our client has a parts supplier which has an annual business of around $400m (90% of their total business was done with our client). On one day, our client company\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s CEO gets a call from their supplier that due to financial troubles, they are going to shut down operations from next month onwards. The case was about recommending solutions to our client in this scenario
valid,Synthesis presentation round with two senior managers : The third round was act based with a senior manager acting as a client. I briefly gave the synthesis of the case with my recommendations. This was followed by a few counter questions asked by senior manager (acting as a client) which I answered briefly.

invalid,Questions on hypothesis testing
valid,Why consulting?
valid,Why Deloitte?
valid,Asked me to sing as I looked nervous in the beginning of the interview
valid,How your analytical skills will help in consulting
valid,It was a case based round. A case was provided which dealt with the sources of revenues and profit and the various advertisement mediums to be reckoned for the summer Olympics in 2015. It was a calculation intensive case, so it involved simple calculations for which the interviewer gave some time. Went for around 40 minutes
valid,The case which was discussed in Round 2 had to be presented to a senior partner. What followed was an in-depth discussion on the same case and another case. This round lasted for around 30 minutes
valid,Quick chat about the CV, some relevant interest areas around my work-ex and some PoR\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s
valid,Case around Computers/Laptops manufacturer\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s service revenue increase : There is a computers/laptop manufacturer, global leader, with two revenue streams \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c Primary selling of products Service revenues from maintenance, repair and replacement parts Global average split is 75%-25% respectively but India split is 95%-5%.  Problem Statement: To increase revenue stream from services in India
valid,Brief introduction followed by a case
valid,The case was concerning a mobile device manufacturer facing a decline in profits. It had opened new stores through a franchisee recently and started selling products at a lower price. This had affected the equation with the set of old retailers. In addition the margins provided to the retailers by the client weren\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t competitive which were causing it to lose sales
valid,The interviewer had shaken things up a little by doing away with the conventional over the table discussion and the case was solved on a blackboard. Problem statement was developing a presentation to be made at a round table conference of procurement managers. I started off by laying out the broad structure of the presentation. Later the discussion moved onto coming up with different environmental factors that need to be included which would concern the day to day work of a procurement manager. I bucketed these factors into Political, Economic, Social, Technical and generated ideas for each backing them up with recent events eg. Under economic factors one of the concerns was currency fluctuation which would affect price of procurement and how hedging could mitigate the risk
valid,Brief introduction followed by a couple of experience based questions
valid,The case was about a pharmaceutical company launching a new vaccine and looking to decide upon a pricing strategy. I listed the 3 factors I would consider to fix the price point - manufacturing and selling costs, pricing of competitive products, value of product to customer. The interviewer directed me to consider the first factor since there were no competing products and the third factor was very qualitative. The problem was then reduced to estimating the size of market, forecasting sales and asking questions to get complete information about the costs involved (R&D, Patents were major costs)
invalid,Introduction and basic questions
valid,The case involved estimating the demand for the upcoming Mumbai metro. I proceeded by breaking the problem into three parts \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c shifting of passengers from Mumbai local, shifting of passengers from other modes of public transport, people shifting from private to public transport. I made reasonable assumptions about the % of passengers that would shift from each segment on the basis of the information I had about the metro routes. Post that there was some calculation involved in estimating the size of each segment as frequency multiplied by capacity (separately for peak and non-peak hours)
